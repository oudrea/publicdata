However, he eventually joined an organized team, the Atlante' Juniors team, going on to win the championship title in 1946. When he was 16, Mendoza returned to the U.S. where he settled in his home town of Granite City, IL. Upon his return to the St Louis area he played for many local teams until he landed a spot with Zenthoefer Furs in 1951.

A prolific goal scorer, he spent most of his years either on the left wing or as a forward where he had a reputation for skillful and accurate headers. Wearing the number 10 jersey, he was known throughout the league for his ability to perform and score using the "" bicycle kick "" .

1AB9CWXLU3VeV2r15QCPYt,Vincent K. McMahon,404479,"Vincent Kennedy McMahon ( ; born August 24, 1945) is an American professional wrestling promoter and executive, and also media proprietor. He is currently serving as the chairman and chief executive officer of WWE, the largest professional wrestling promotion in the world. He is also the founder and owner of Alpha Entertainment. McMahon was born in Pinehurst, North Carolina, and graduated from East Carolina University with a degree in business in 1968. He worked for WWE for his father as a commentator and he assumed control of the company in 1982; McMahon saw the commercial potential of monopolizing the industry, which previously operated as separate fiefdoms across the United States. This led to the development of the annual WrestleMania, which has since become the most successful professional wrestling event ever. WWE faced industry competition from World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in the 1990s, before purchasing the competing company in 2001. WWE also purchased the assets of the defunct Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) in 2003. McMahon has embarked on a number of WWE-related ventures; in 2014, he launched the WWE Network, a subscription video on-demand over-the-top streaming service. McMahon also owns other WWE subsidiaries related to multimedia, such as film, music, and magazines, as well as a professional wrestling school system. Outside of wrestling, McMahon joint-owned and operated the XFL, a football league, twice; both iterations folded after a single season with the second due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He also headed the short-lived World Bodybuilding Federation, and co-owns the clothing brand Tapout. McMahon also worked as a professional wrestler and personality known by the ring name Mr. McMahon, using a gimmick based on his real-life persona. He was the broadcast color commentator and chief broadcaster until 1997, and is a two-time world champion, a Royal Rumble match winner, and has headlined multiple WWE pay-per-view events. He is the eldest living member of the McMahon family, and is a third-generation wrestling promoter, following his grandfather Jess and father Vincent. He married political executive Linda Edwards in 1966, and is the father of businesspeople Stephanie and Shane McMahon, and father-in-law to Triple H. Early life Vincent Kennedy McMahon was born on August 24, 1945, in Pinehurst, North Carolina, the younger son of Victoria (née Askew) and Vincent James McMahon. His father left the family when McMahon was still a baby and took his elder son Rod with him, so McMahon did not meet his father until the age of 12. McMahon's paternal grandfather was promoter Roderick James "" Jess "" McMahon, whose parents were Irish immigrants from County Galway.   His paternal grandmother, Rose Davis, was also of Irish descent. McMahon was raised as Vinnie Lupton and spent the majority of his childhood living with his mother and a string of stepfathers. He claimed that one of his stepfathers, Leo Lupton, used to beat his mother and attacked McMahon when he tried to protect her. He later said, "" It is unfortunate that he died before I could kill him. I would have enjoyed that. "" He attended Fishburne Military School in Waynesboro, Virginia, graduating in 1964. In his early life, he also overcame dyslexia.","Pinehurst, North Carolina, U.S.",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_McMahon,Vincent Kennedy McMahon,,,

While living in Costa Rica, he produced a bi-weekly radio program for Radio for Peace International; a compilation of this work was released as Memory Hole 1.

Early years Moore, who was born on Long Island, New York, began his music career in Kings Park, Long Island, learning piano at the age of six and writing his first song at the age of 12. After graduating from high school in 1985, Moore briefly attended SUNY Fredonia, where he studied classical music, before returning home to form the band Majesty with childhood friends guitarist John Petrucci and bassist John Myung, who had recruited drummer Mike Portnoy (a fellow Long Islander) during their short enrollment at Berklee College of Music. Singer Chris Collins handled vocal duties for Majesty, but he was subsequently replaced by Charlie Dominici (and eventually James LaBrie) and the band was renamed Dream Theater.","Long Island, New York, U.S.",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Moore,,,,

1R4mr4yPMo1almNtQgBQgD,John Andrew Henry Forrest,113580046,"John Andrew Henry Forrest  (born 5 July 1961), nicknamed Twiggy, is an Australian businessman. He is best known as the former CEO (and current non-executive chairman) of Fortescue Metals Group (FMG), and has other interests in the mining industry and in cattle stations. With an assessed net worth of 27.25 & nbsp;billion according to the Financial Review 2021 Rich List, Forrest was ranked as the second richest Australian. According to the Financial Review, Forrest was the richest person in Australia in 2008.  In 2013, Andrew and Nicola Forrest, his wife, were the first Australian billionaires to pledge the majority of their wealth to charity in their lifetimes. He had earlier stepped down as CEO of Fortescue Metals in 2011. Much of the Forrest's philanthropy has been through either the Minderoo Foundation (focusing on education and Indigenous Australians) or the Walk Free Foundation (focusing on ending modern slavery), both of which he established. Forrest has been accused of avoiding paying company tax, having revealed in 2011 that Fortescue had never paid company tax.  Early life Forrest was born in Perth, Western Australia, the youngest of three children of Judith (née Fry) and Donald Forrest. His father, grandfather (Mervyn), and great-grandfather (David) were all managers of Minderoo Station, which David had established in 1878 with his brothers, Alexander and John. John, Alexander, David, and Mervyn were all members of parliament for periods, with John serving as Western Australia's first premier.   Forrest's early years were spent at Minderoo, located in the Pilbara region south of Onslow. Minderoo was owned by the Forrest family until it was sold in 1998 by his father due to relentless drought and debt, but it was bought back by Forrest in 2009.  Forrest was educated at Onslow Primary School and through the School of the Air before moving to Perth to attend Christ Church Grammar School and then Hale School. He stuttered as a child, which is how he came to develop a relationship with Ian Black, whose Aboriginal father, Scotty, became Forrest's mentor. Forrest went on to the University of Western Australia where he majored in economics and politics.","Perth, Western Australia, Australia",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Forrest,John Andrew Henry Forrest < ref >  < /ref >,,,

1WIQRyYCFlZeItIKAAjcwk,Joseph C. Tsai,228733973,"Joseph Chung-Hsin Tsai  full name is given with NY State Unified Court System attorney registry, retrieved 11 February 2020 ( ; born January 1964) is a Taiwanese-Hong Kong-Canadian billionaire businessman and philanthropist.   He is a co-founder and executive vice chairman of Chinese multinational technology company Alibaba Group. Born in Taiwan and educated in the U.S., he is a naturalized citizen of Canada. He owns the Brooklyn Nets of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and has interests in several other professional sports franchises. Early life, family, and education Joseph Tsai was born in Taipei, Taiwan to Paul C. Tsai ( , d. 4 May 2013), a second-generation lawyer, and Ruby Tsai. He has three younger siblings, Eva, Vivian, and Benjamin.  The Tsai family escaped to Taiwan as part of the Kuomintang exodus after the Chinese Communist Party took over control of mainland China in 1949. At age 13, Tsai was sent to the U.S. to attend the Lawrenceville School in Lawrenceville, New Jersey, where he played both lacrosse and football (inside linebacker) and was a member of the Cleve House. Tsai enrolled at his father's alma mater, Yale University. He played for the Yale varsity lacrosse team for four years and has remained a supporter of the team. Tsai earned a B.A. in Economics and East Asian studies from Yale College in 1986. In 1990, he earned a J.D. from Yale Law School, where he was articles editor of the Yale Law & Policy Review.  Career Tsai became a tax associate at the white-shoe law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell after graduation and was admitted as an attorney to the New York bar on 6 May 1991.  After three years at the law firm, he switched to private equity and joined Rosecliff, Inc., a small management buyout firm based in New York, as vice president and general counsel. He left for Hong Kong in 1995 to join Investor AB, where he was responsible for its Asian private equity investments.  It was in this role that he first met Jack Ma in 1999 in Hangzhou after being introduced by a friend who was trying to sell his own company to Ma. Tsai was impressed with Ma's idea to create an international import and export marketplace, as well as his charismatic personality, but it was Ma's followers and their energy and enthusiasm that ultimately convinced Tsai. Later that year he quit the $700,000-a-year job at Investor AB and offered to join Ma as a member of the founding team for almost nothing. At the time each of Alibaba's 18 co-founders—of which Tsai was the only Western-educated member—accepted a salary of only $600 a year. He served as chief operating officer, chief financial officer, and founding board member. He single-handedly established Alibaba's financial and legal structure, since no other member of the team had any experience in venture capital or law. In May 2013, he became Alibaba's executive vice chairman. He has become the second-largest individual shareholder of Alibaba after Ma.","Taipei, Taiwan",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Tsai,Tsai Chung-hsin,,,

She wrote Unapologetically Ambitious and co-authored Marketing That Works. Archambeau is a regular contributor for Xconomy.  Early life and education Archambeau grew up as the oldest of four children. Her parents had four kids in five years, attributing her competitive nature to growing up with siblings so close in age.

Career After graduation, Archambeau took a full-time job with IBM where she would eventually have a 15-year career, working her way up the corporate ladder. She stated that one of her goals was to run a company and that she had aspirations of becoming the CEO of IBM, working her way through various positions and later running IBM's Asia Pacific business for the public sector.

Early life Mary Eliza McDowell was born on November 30, 1854 to Malcolm and Jane Welch Gordon McDowell in Cincinnati, Ohio as the oldest of six children. Her father was recognized for his distinguished service in the Civil War and support for the presidency helped to establish her political conviction. After the war, the family left for Chicago where her father opened and managed a steel rolling mill and the family joined the Methodist Church.

In the family's first few years in Chicago, McDowell was involved in various relief efforts and religious involvement. During the Great Chicago Fire in 1871, McDowell and her father worked to help refugees by transporting people and their belongings to the makeshift camp away from the fire. When aid was received from Ohio, McDowell took the lead in the relief effort and was later recognized by President Rutherford B. Hayes for her service. She later organized religious classes for young people that attracted prominent figures in the temperance movement, students from Northwestern University, and residents of Chicago.  Career McDowell first began work for Frances Williard, founder of the Women's Christian Temperance Movement, where she met Elizabeth Harrison.

2exXzuhk9Xkfeu081vIq07,John Michael Howard,242406193,"John Winston Howard  (born 26 July 1939) is an Australian former politician who served as the 25th Prime Minister of Australia (1996–2007) and Leader of the Liberal Party (1985–1989; 1995–2007). His nearly twelve-year tenure as Prime Minister is the second-longest in history, behind only Sir Robert Menzies, who served for eighteen non-consecutive years. He has also been the oldest living former Australian Prime Minister since the death of Bob Hawke in 2019. Howard was born in Sydney and studied law at the University of Sydney. He was a commercial lawyer before entering parliament. A former federal president of the Young Liberals, he first stood for office at the 1968 New South Wales state election, but lost narrowly. At the 1974 federal election, Howard was elected to the Division of Bennelong, which he would go on to represent until 2007. He was promoted to cabinet in 1977, and later in the year replaced Phillip Lynch as Treasurer of Australia, remaining in that position until the defeat of Malcolm Fraser's government in 1983. In 1985, Howard was elected leader of the Liberal Party for the first time, thus replacing Andrew Peacock as Leader of the Opposition. He led the Liberal–National coalition to the 1987 federal election, but lost to Bob Hawke's Labor government, and was removed from the leadership in 1989. Remaining a key figure in the party, Howard was re-elected leader in 1995 (replacing Alexander Downer), and subsequently led the Coalition to victory at the 1996 federal election. After defeating Paul Keating's Labor government in 1996, the Howard Government was re-elected at the 1998, 2001 and 2004 elections. Howard's actions as prime minister included new gun laws (in response to the Port Arthur massacre), the introduction of a nationwide value-added tax, immigration reform, and industrial relations reform. Australia also contributed troops to the War in Afghanistan and the Iraq War under his government, and led the International Force for East Timor. The Howard government was defeated at the 2007 federal election, with the Labor Party's Kevin Rudd succeeding him as prime minister. Howard also lost his own seat at the election, becoming only the second prime minister to do so (after Stanley Bruce in 1929). Early and personal life John Winston Howard is the fourth son of Mona (née Kell) and Lyall Howard. His parents were married in 1925. Howard was also known as "" Jack "" in his youth. His older brothers were Stanley (1926–2014), Walter (b. 1929) and Robert (b. 1936). Lyall Howard was an admirer of Winston Churchill. Howard's ancestors were English, Scottish, and Irish. He is descended from convict William Tooley, who was transported to New South Wales in 1816 for stealing a watch.","Earlwood, New South Wales, Australia",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard,John Winston Howard,,,

Spiegel was the youngest billionaire in the world in 2015.  Early life and education Spiegel was born in Los Angeles, California to lawyers John W. Spiegel and Melissa Ann Thomas. He grew up in Pacific Palisades, California, where he was raised Episcopalian. He was educated at the Crossroads School for Arts and Sciences in Santa Monica, and attended Stanford University.

Spiegel is a member of the Kappa Sigma fraternity.  Career In April 2011, while studying product design at Stanford, Spiegel proposed an app with ephemeral messaging as a product design class project, an idea which his classmates ridiculed. Later that year, Spiegel worked with fellow Stanford classmates Bobby Murphy and Reggie Brown to launch a prototype of this concept called "" Picaboo "" , which they later renamed as Snapchat.   The app's popularity grew significantly and in 2012, Evan left Stanford to focus on Snapchat shortly before completing his degree.  By the end of 2012, Spiegel's Snapchat app had reached 1 million daily active users.","Los Angeles, California, U.S.",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Spiegel,Evan Thomas Spiegel,,,

As a child he dabbled in art but it wasn't until high school that he began taking art classes. When not creating art he also played sports; football and basketball, and enjoyed chemistry and geology.  He was told he was good at drawing, and replaced study hall classes with art classes, receiving instruction and inspiration from a Welsh teacher named R. Idris Thomas. While in high school Beauchamp would go, every Monday, to the public library and a local museum where he would read books about art; specifically French painting, as assigned by Thomas. Beauchamp would spend upwards of four hours a day in the art room and eventually won the Carter Memorial Prize, which provided a scholarship to the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center. At Colorado Springs he studied under Boardman Robinson, painting landscapes in nature.","Denver, Colorado, U.S.",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Beauchamp,Robert John Beauchamp,,1923,March 1995

Early life Carlton George Douglas was born in Kingston, Colony of Jamaica. He later lived in the U.S. state of California before relocating to London, England as a teenager. He spent his childhood in England playing football, and vocal training. In his youth he developed a passion for jazz music (citing Sam Cooke and Otis Redding as his biggest influences) and a trained tenor voice, which he would display in church singing various religious songs.  Career Douglas's career was based in the United Kingdom. His single "" Kung Fu Fighting "" ranked number one on both the U.K. Singles Chart and the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in 1974. The single sold 11 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling singles of all time. The single was later certified Gold by the RIAA on 27 November 1974.  The single, which is a homage to martial arts films, has overshadowed the rest of Douglas's career, and has led to his appearance on other artists' versions of the song. In the United States, Douglas is considered a one-hit wonder, since he is known only for "" Kung Fu Fighting "" and the follow-up "" Dance the Kung Fu "" did not crack the Top 40. However, in the United Kingdom, two of his other singles made it into the Top 40: "" Dance the Kung Fu "" , which peaked at number 35 in the charts, and "" Run Back "" , which peaked at number 25.","Kingston, Colony of Jamaica",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Douglas,Carlton George Douglas,,,

3u54xQZBgfBbl2MBA2rgqG,Timothy Sweeney,253373531,"Timothy Dean Sweeney (born December 1970) is an American video game programmer, businessman and conservationist, known as the founder and CEO of Epic Games and as the creator of the Unreal Engine, a game development platform. Early life Sweeney was raised in Potomac, Maryland, the youngest of three brothers. At a young age, he became interested in tinkering with mechanical and electrical devices, and stated he had taken apart a lawnmower as early as five or six, and later built his own go-kart. He became interested in arcade games when they began to become popular in the late 1970s, knowing that like the mechanics devices he took apart and repaired, there were those that had programmed the games in the machines. Though the family got an Atari 2600, Sweeney was not as interested in the games for that, outside of Adventure, and later said he had not played many video games in his life and very few to completion.  At the age of 11, Sweeney visited his older brother's new startup in California, where he had access to early IBM Personal Computers. Sweeney spent the week there, learning BASIC and establishing his interest in programming; while he had had a Commodore 64 before, Sweeney was much more taken by how easy the IBM PC was to use. When his family got an Apple II, Sweeney began in earnest learning how to program on that, trying to make Adventure 2 in the spirit of the Atari 2600 game. Sweeney estimated that between the ages of 11 and 15, he spent over 10,000 hours teaching himself how to program using information on online bulletin boards, and completed several games, though never shared these with others. He also learned from his brothers concepts of entrepreneurship. As a teenager, he made a good deal of money by offering to mow lawns of wealthy residents in the area for half the price of professional services.  Founding of Epic Games Sweeney attended the University of Maryland starting around 1989, where he studied mechanical engineering, though he was still fascinated by computers. Around this time, his father, who worked for the Defense Mapping Agency, gave him an IBM Personal Computer/AT. Sweeney established a consulting business, Potomac Computer Systems, out of his parents' home to offer help with computers, but it never took off and he shelved the company. Later, Sweeney had the idea of creating games that could be sold, programming them at night or over weekends outside college work. This first required him to create a text editor based on the Pascal language to be able to program the game, which led to the idea of making a game out of the text editor itself. This became the basis of ZZT. He let college friends and those around his neighborhood to provide feedback, and was aware it was something he could sell to other computer users. To distribute the game, Sweeney looked to the shareware model, and wrote to Scott Miller of Apogee Software, Ltd., a leading shareware producer at the time, for ideas on how to distribute ZZT. He revitalized Potomac Computer Systems for selling ZZT, fulfilling mail orders with help of his father. ZZT sold well enough, a few copies each day that came to about  per day, that Sweeney decided to make developing games his career. Recognizing he needed a better name for a video game company, he renamed Potomac Computer Systems to Epic MegaGames.","Potomac, Maryland, U.S.",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Sweeney_(game_developer),"Timothy Dean Sweeney < ref name= "" justia "" >  < /ref >",,,

43HVvHc8MKxdCQhu1bgxU6,Adam Neumann,301201235,"Adam Neumann ( ; born April 25, 1979) is an Israeli-American businessman. In 2010, he co-founded WeWork with Miguel McKelvey.  Following mounting pressure from investors based on disclosures made in its S-1 filing, Neumann resigned as CEO of WeWork and gave up majority voting control as of September 26, 2019. WeWork also delayed its initial public offering (IPO) until the end of 2019 amid growing investor concerns over its corporate governance, valuation, and outlook for the business. On September 30, 2019, WeWork formally withdrew its S-1 filing and postponed the IPO. He served as WeWork's CEO from 2010 & ndash;2019.  Early life and education The Neumann family, from Israel, is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Neumann's parents, both physicians, Avivit and Doron Neumann, divorced when he was seven years old. He and his younger sister, Israeli model Adi Neumann, moved to the United States with their mother for her medical residency. Dyslexic, Neumann could not read or write until third grade. In 1990, after four years in the US, they returned to Israel and settled in kibbutz Nir Am. He graduated from the Israeli Naval Academy and served as an officer in the Israeli Navy for five years and was discharged with the rank of seren (lieutenant). He later attended the Zicklin School of Business at Baruch College in New York City.  Career Prior to founding WeWork, Neumann founded a children's clothing company, Krawlers.  Neumann and McKelvey began working together, having met through a mutual friend, on Green Desk in 2008, a shared-workspace business focusing on sustainability, the precursor to WeWork. The pair sold their interest in Green Desk and using the funds along with a $15 million investment from Brooklyn real estate developer Joel Schreiber for a 33% interest in the company, they founded WeWork in 2010. Neumann stated that with WeWork, he intended to replicate the feeling of togetherness and belonging he felt in Israel and that he thought was lacking in the West.","Tel Aviv, Israel",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Neumann,,,,

Archibald is the only athlete in Weber State's history to receive this honor. ==Career== Archibald held various management positions before leading the consumer durables division of the Beatrice Company, whose brands included Stiffle lamps, Samsonite luggage and Aristokraft kitchen cabinets. He joined Black & Decker as president and chief operating officer in September 1985. When appointed president and chief executive officer in March 1986 at the age of 42, Archibald was the youngest CEO of a Fortune 500 Company.  In 1989 Archibald made the near disastrous mis-step of out-bidding other companies to purchase Emhart Corporation for $2.8B in debt. Black & Decker was able to service the debt because of profit from the launch of DeWalt in 1992 and subsequent success in becoming the world's largest professional and industrial power tools brand.","Ogden, UT < ref name=stgeorge >  < /ref >",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_D._Archibald,,,,

4WwRzkzCpPUbrznBZclqRx,Judy Carol Lewent,45319127,"Judith Carol Lewent is a business executive who served as chief financial officer of Merck & Co. from 1990 until her retirement from the company in 2007. Since her retirement from Merck, she has continued to serve on multiple corporate boards, including the boards of GlaxoSmithKline, Thermo Fisher Scientific and Motorola Solutions. She also served on the board of Purdue Pharma until her departure from the company in 2014.  Early life Lewent received her high school diploma at Hunter College High School, her B.S. in Economics from Goucher College, and her S.M. in 1972 from the MIT Sloan School of Management with thesis titled The French Open-end Investment Companies (1964 to 1971): an Application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model.  Career Joining Merck in 1980, Lewent developed a new planning model in 1983 based on the Monte Carlo method, as more traditional financial valuation methods seemed not to take account of the long-term nature of pharmaceutical risks. In 1990, on her appointment as CFO, Lewent took on responsibilities for Merck's overall financial and strategic development, and for licensing matters. Since then Lewent has also been responsible for Merck's collaboration with Johnson & Johnson in a consumer pharmaceuticals joint venture, for the setting up of the animal health company Merial (a joint venture with the French pharmaceutical company Sanofi-Aventis), and for Merck's ongoing relationships with AstraZeneca and DuPont. She chaired the governing boards of several of these joint ventures.",,en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_Lewent,,,,

4gGhq8CVGHxfkPtaY9aYkL,Herbert W. Boyer,707496,"Herbert Wayne "" Herb "" Boyer (born July 10, 1936) is a researcher and entrepreneur in biotechnology. Along with Stanley N. Cohen and Paul Berg he discovered a method to coax bacteria into producing foreign proteins, thereby jump starting the field of genetic engineering. By 1969, he performed studies on a couple of restriction enzymes of the E.coli bacterium with especially useful properties. He is recipient of the 1990 National Medal of Science, co-recipient of the 1996 Lemelson–MIT Prize, and a co-founder of Genentech. He was professor at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and later served as Vice President of Genentech from 1976 until his retirement in 1991.  Life and career Herbert Boyer was born in 1936 in Derry, Pennsylvania. He received his bachelor's degree in biology and chemistry from Saint Vincent College in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, in 1958. He married his wife Grace the following year. He received his PhD at the University of Pittsburgh in 1963 and participated as an activist in the civil rights movement. He spent three years in post-graduate work at Yale University in the laboratories of Professors Edward Adelberg and Bruce Carlton, then became an assistant professor at the University of California, San Francisco and a Professor of Biochemistry from 1976 to 1991, where he discovered that genes from bacteria could be combined with genes from eukaryotes. In 1977, Boyer's laboratory and collaborators Keiichi Itakura and Arthur Riggs at City of Hope National Medical Center described the first-ever synthesis and expression of a peptide-coding gene. In August 1978, he produced synthetic insulin using his new transgenic genetically modified bacteria, followed in 1979 by a growth hormone. In 1976, Boyer founded Genentech with venture capitalist Robert A. Swanson. Genentech's approach to the first synthesis of insulin won out over Walter Gilbert's approach at Biogen which used whole genes from natural sources. Boyer built his gene from its individual nucleotides.",,en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Boyer,,,,

Taylor won the 1996 24 hours of Daytona and 1996 12 hours of Sebring with Scott Sharp and Jim Pace (racing driver) in a Riley & Scott Mk III Oldsmobile. He was once more IMSA WSC champion in 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998. In 1998 he won the Petit Le Mans and the prototype class in the 24 Hours of Daytona. He competed in the American Le Mans Series in 1999. From 2000 to 2002, he was a central part of the Cadillac Le Mans effort. It was handled by his long-time technical partner in 2000 Bob Riley before the chassis program was moved in England and an updated car was built for 2001, followed by a completely new car, the LMP-02, in 2002. Unfortunately, it was not successful against Audi's R8 and even privately entered LMPs, so GM discontinued the program at the end of the year. Taylor tried to secure funding to run a privateer effort with the car, but instead eventually continued with Cadillac in the Speed World Challenge CTS-V effort.","Port Elizabeth, South Africa",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Taylor,,,,

After his death in 1953, Wren was buried at Boroondara Cemetery in Kew. Early life John Wren was born in Collingwood, Melbourne on 3 April 1871.

He left school at the age of 12 and worked in a wood-yard and as a boot clicker, while supplementing his wage through various gambling activities. Losing his job in the 1890s depression, he commenced a horse racing gambling venture at his Johnston Street totalizator, which eventually earned him £20,000 per year.

Khosrowshahi was previously CEO of Expedia Group, a company that owns several travel fare aggregators. He is also a member of the board of directors of BET.com, and Hotels.com, and previously served on the board of The New York Times Company.  Khosrowshahi is on the list of "" Prominent Iranian-Americans "" published by the U.S. Virtual Embassy Iran.  Early life and education Khosrowshahi was born in 1969 in Iran into a wealthy family and grew up in a mansion on the family compound.  He is the youngest of the three children of Lili and Asghar (Gary) Khosrowshahi.   His family founded the Alborz Investment Company, a diversified conglomerate involved in pharmaceuticals, chemicals, food, distribution, packaging, trading, and services.  In 1978, just before the Iranian Revolution, his family was targeted for its wealth and his mother decided to leave everything behind and flee the country. Their company was later nationalized. His family first fled to southern France. They were planning to come back to Iran if the revolution failed, but when that didn't happen, they immigrated to the United States, moving in with one of his uncles in Tarrytown, New York.  In 1982, when Khosrowshahi was 13 years old, his father went to Iran to care for his grandfather.

He was preceded by Orin Smith, who led the company since 2000, and was succeeded by the coffeehouse's second president, Howard Schultz. Donald also served in various executive po sitions Albertsons. Early life and education Donald grew up in Florida and started working as a grocery bagger in Tampa when he was 16. Donald graduated with a bachelor's degree in Business Administration from American Century University in Albuquerque, New Mexico. From 1976 to 1991, he held several managerial positions with Albertsons. While working at Albertsons, Donald pursued his undergraduate degree. It took 15 years for Donald to finish his degree because he was constantly moved to revamp distressed stores for Albertsons.  Career In 1991, he was recruited by Sam Walton to join Walmart to lead the development of its grocery business and Superstore concept. Walmart was experimenting with selling groceries at six stores but hadn't figured out how to expand the concept. Donald revamped the company's dysfunctional distribution center, which hadn't been designed for grocery storage. By the time he left three years later, Walmart had added grocery sales in 140 more stores. Donald left Walmart for Safeway in 1994, serving as senior vice president of its 130-store eastern division until 1996.  At Safeway Donald was responsible for a $2.5 billion business with more than 10,000 employees. He succeeded in reversing Safeway's four-year trend of declining same-store sales. Donald's first CEO role was at Pathmark Stores from 1996 to 2002. He took over Pathmark while the store chain was struggling with debt. Donald filed for a prepackaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy after a deal to sell the company failed. This strategy allowed him to "" slough off debt and reemerge with a public company, "" according to an article published by Forbes.  Donald joined Starbucks in 2002 as president of the North American division. Donald replaced Orin Smith as CEO on April 1, 2005.  In January 2008, Donald was replaced by Howard Schultz. During his tenure, Starbucks enjoyed record growth, including five straight years of 20%+ annual earnings increases. In 2009, in an effort to reverse its ailing fortunes, Haggen Food & Pharmacy named Donald president and CEO. Within two years Haggen was sold to Comvest Group. The new owners replaced Donald as CEO.",,en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Donald_(businessman),James Donald,,,

With his brother Bill France, Jr., he inherited control of NASCAR and ISC upon his father's death in 1992, and, as a member, and for a time secretary, of the board of directors of NASCAR, he served influentially   as an advisor to his brother through the latter's retirement as NASCAR president in 2000 and as NASCAR CEO and chairman of the board in 2004; France, Jr., explained in 2000 that his singular prominence notwithstanding, the two jointly guided NASCAR and ISC, joking that, "" In the past, we'd have a board meeting in the hall. My brother and I would meet and shoot the breeze for a few minutes "" .  Upon the accession of Brian France to the chairmanship of NASCAR in 2003, Jim France served his nephew in a similar advisory role, most significantly after the 2007 death of France, Jr.  On August 6, 2018, France assumed the role of Interim CEO and Chairman of NASCAR, following the arrest of his nephew and CEO Brian France; France was arrested on suspicion of DUI in Sag Harbor, New York on August 5, 2018. With Brian taking an official leave of absence from all NASCAR duties until his legal case is resolved, the interim part of Jim's title was dropped and he became CEO and Chairman of NASCAR.","Daytona Beach, Florida",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_France,James Carl France,,,

6NPT3TR0guXdrhrf090NFp,Thomas Pechy Peterffy,30176336,"The native form of this personal name is Péterffy Tamás. This article uses Western name order when mentioning individuals. Thomas Peterffy (born September 30, 1944) is a Hungarian-born American billionaire businessman. He is the founder, chairman, and the largest shareholder of Interactive Brokers.  Peterffy worked as an architectural draftsman after emigrating to the US, and later became a computer programmer. In 1977, he purchased a seat on the American Stock Exchange and played a role in developing the first electronic trading platform for securities. According to Forbes, with a fortune of 25 billion dollars in 2021, Peterffy was the 65th richest man in the world and the richest Hungarian, far ahead of George Soros (8.6 billion dollars), Charles Simonyi (5 billion dollars) and Steven F. Udvar-Házy (4.3 billion dollars).  Early life and career Peterffy was born in Budapest, Hungary on September 30, 1944, in a hospital basement during a Russian air raid. His father emigrated to the US after the failure of the Hungarian Revolution in 1956. Peterffy left his engineering studies in Hungary and emigrated to the United States to rendezvous with his father in New York in 1965. When his father, who was living with his second wife, did not have room to accommodate his son, he gave Thomas $100 and told him to “make something of himself.”  When he moved to New York City, he did not speak English. Peterffy began his career in the US as an architectural draftsman working on highway projects for an engineering firm. It was at this firm that he volunteered to program a newly purchased computer. Of his background in programming Peterffy said, “I think the way a CEO runs his company is a reflection of his background. Business is a collection of processes, and my job is to automate those processes so that they can be done with the greatest amount of efficiency.” Peterffy left his career designing financial modelling software and bought a seat on the American Stock Exchange to trade equity options. During his career in finance, he has consistently pushed to replace manual processes with more efficient automated ones. He wrote code in his head during the trading day and then applied his ideas to computerized trading models after hours. Peterffy created a major stir among traders by introducing handheld computers onto the trading floor in the early 1980s.  His business related to his AMEX seat eventually developed into Interactive Brokers.","Budapest, Hungary",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Peterffy,,,,

From 1911 until 1927, he pitched for the Pittsburgh Pirates (1911–12), Brooklyn Robins (1915–17, 1919–1922) and Cleveland Indians (1922–1927). Smith batted right-handed and threw left-handed. He was born in Monticello, Georgia. Smith was the hard-luck loser of one of the longest World Series games ever played. He pitched all the way into the 14th inning for Brooklyn, dueling with Boston's starting pitcher, Babe Ruth, in Game 2 of the 1916 World Series until the Red Sox won it 2-1. It would be his only appearance in that Series. He made two strong starts in the 1920 World Series. Smith was the winning pitcher of Game 3 against Cleveland, throwing a three-hitter in a 2-1 victory. But despite another impressive effort in Game 6, he lost a 1-0 duel with Duster Mails, and Brooklyn ended up losing that Series in seven games. Placed on waivers after the 1922 season, Smith was claimed by Cleveland and pitched there for several seasons. He led all American League pitchers in 1925 in complete games with 22, also leading the league that season in walks and hits allowed. In a 14-season career, Smith posted a 114–118 record with 428 strikeouts and a 3.32 ERA in 2,052.2 innings pitched.","Monticello, Georgia",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherry_Smith,,"Reidsville, Georgia",,

For his work in statistics, he has been described as "" a genius who almost single-handedly created the foundations for modern statistical science "" and "" the single most important figure in 20th century statistics "" . . In genetics, his work used mathematics to combine Mendelian genetics and natural selection; this contributed to the revival of Darwinism in the early 20th-century revision of the theory of evolution known as the modern synthesis. For his contributions to biology, Fisher has been called "" the greatest of Darwin’s successors "" .  Fisher held strong views on race and eugenics, insisting on racial differences. Notably, he was a dissenting voice in the 1950 UNESCO statement The Race Question.  In his own words: "" Available scientific knowledge provides a firm basis for believing that the groups of mankind differ in their innate capacity for intellectual and emotional development "" . He was the Galton Professor of Eugenics at University College London and editor of the Annals of Eugenics.  From 1919 onward, he worked at the Rothamsted Experimental Station for 14 years; there, he analysed its immense data from crop experiments since the 1840s, and developed the analysis of variance (ANOVA). He established his reputation there in the following years as a biostatistician. He is known as one of the three principal founders of population genetics. He outlined Fisher's principle, the Fisherian runaway and sexy son hypothesis theories of sexual selection. His contributions to statistics include promoting the method of maximum likelihood and deriving the properties of maximum likelihood estimators, fiducial inference, the derivation of various sampling distributions, founding principles of the design of experiments, and much more.

It was his work building a small 22-unit motel (Motel 27) on the outskirts of Toronto for family friend, Jack Gould, that was his introduction to the hospitality business.  Four Seasons: The Story of a Business Philosophy  He founded the Four Seasons Hotel in 1960 and opened the first hotel on Jarvis Street in downtown Toronto in 1961.  On November 6, 2006, American business magnate Bill Gates, through his holding company Cascade Investments LLC, and Saudi businessman, Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal through his company Kingdom Holding Company made an offer to take Four Seasons Hotels private for US$3.4 billion (excluding debt).   Sharp would remain chairman and chief executive of the company. He also would be able to realize proceeds from a 1989 incentive plan that would pay him $288 million; the company's headquarters would remain in Toronto. Philanthropy Sharp helped start and is the director of the Terry Fox Run. He first met Terry Fox when the latter arrived in Montreal in June 1980 during his trek across the country to raise money for cancer research. Sharp invited Fox to rest in one of the city's Four Seasons hotels for a week before resuming his run, helped pay for his cancer treatment, and later pledged to contribute to research funds on his behalf.","Toronto, Ontario, Canada",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isadore_Sharp,,,,

Agnelli served as Executive Member and Chairman of the European Club Association, and was appointed to the UEFA Executive Committee in 2015. He is a member of the industrialist Agnelli family. He is also a board member of Stellantis and Exor. Early life Agnelli is the son of late Juventus F.C. chairman and senator of the Italian Republic Umberto Agnelli, CEO of FIAT from 1970 to 1976, and Donna Allegra Caracciolo di Castagneto (b. 1945), first cousin of Marella Agnelli, born Donna Marella Caracciolo di Castagneto and daughter of Filippo Caracciolo, 8th Prince di Castagneto, 3rd Duke di Melito, and a hereditary Patrician of Naples (1903–1965). Marella, widow of Agnelli's uncle Gianni, and Allegra and, therefore, Andrea, are both members of an old Neapolitan noble family that hold the titles of Prince of Castagneto and Duke of Melito, among others. Andrea was the last male member of the family to carry the Agnelli surname until the birth of his son Giacomo. He studied at St Clare's in Oxford (not a college of the university), England, and then at Bocconi University in Milan. Career After university, Agnelli started his career in the business world in England and France at companies including Iveco and Auchan Hypermarché. He also spent several years in Switzerland working in marketing and development for Ferrari Idea S.A. and Lausanne-based Philip Morris International. Juventus F.C. In May 2010, he was appointed Chairman of the board of directors of Juventus by his first cousin John Elkann, becoming the fourth member of the Agnelli family to run the football club after his father, his uncle and his grandfather. Elkann had come under criticism from Juventus fans for the club's poor results during the 2009–10 season and many ultras saw Agnelli as the "" rightful "" heir due to his family's long-time association with the club. Despite entering the job during a period when the club was still dealing with the aftermath of the infamous Calciopoli scandal, he is credited with overseeing the club's transition into the new stadium and balancing their finances in wake of the ongoing recession ravaging Italy.   One of his first acts as new chairman was to appoint Sampdoria duo Giuseppe Marotta as Director of Sport and Luigi Delneri as new coach.","Turin, Italy",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Agnelli,,,,

The circumstances of Seyoum's death, during the Tigray War, are disputed: Ethiopian authorities stated that Seyoum was killed while refusing to surrender, while Europe External Programme with Africa (EEPA) stated that he was first taken to Senafe in Eritrea before being returned to Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) control and extrajudicially executed.  Early life and education Seyoum was born on 25 January 1949 in Tigray, Ethiopia, as Ambaye Mesfin. He later changed from Ambaye to Seyoum as a nom de guerre.

7yMq7kPaoioai3nZzmvMjw,Wilmot Reed Hastings,928216,"Wilmot Reed Hastings Jr. (born October 8, 1960) is an American businessman. He is the co-founder, chairman, and co-chief executive officer (CEO) of Netflix, and sits on a number of boards and non-profit organizations. A former member of the California State Board of Education, Hastings is an advocate for education reform through charter schools.  Early life and Education Hastings was born in Boston, Massachusetts. His father Wilmot Reed Hastings was an attorney for the Department of Health, Education and Welfare in the Nixon administration, and his mother Joan Amory Loomis was a Boston debutante from a Social Register family who was repulsed by the world of high society and taught her children to disdain it.     His maternal great-grandfather was Alfred Lee Loomis. Hastings attended Buckingham Browne & Nichols School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and sold vacuum cleaners door-to-door in a gap year before entering college. He graduated from Bowdoin College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Mathematics, which he found "" beautiful and engaging "" .  He joined the Marine Corps officer training through their Platoon Leader Class, and spent college summers in the Marines, including a stint at the Officer Candidate School boot camp at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia in the summer of 1981. He did not complete the training and never commissioned into the Marine Corps—choosing instead to pursue service in the Peace Corps “out of a combination of service and adventure”.  He went to teach math at a high school of around 800 students in rural northwest Swaziland, Africa from 1983 to 1985 after college. He credits part of his entrepreneurial spirit to his time in the Peace Corps, remarking that, “Once you have hitchhiked across Africa with ten bucks in your pocket, starting a business doesn't seem too intimidating”.","Boston, Massachusetts, U.S. < ref name=PCOLNewyorktimes/ >",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Hastings,Wilmot Reed Hastings Jr.,,< ref name=PCOLNewyorktimes/ >,

Ford,568007,"Edsel Bryant Ford (November 6, 1893 – May 26, 1943) was an American business executive and philanthropist who was the son of pioneering industrialist Henry Ford and his wife, Clara Jane Bryant. He was the president of Ford Motor Company from 1919 until his death in 1943. His eldest son was Henry Ford II, who succeeded him as president of Ford. He worked closely with his father, as sole heir to the business, but was keen to develop cars more exciting than the Model T ( "" Tin Lizzie "" ), in line with his personal tastes. Even as president, he had trouble persuading his father to allow any departure from this formula. Only a change in market conditions enabled him to develop the more fashionable Model A in 1927. Edsel also founded the Mercury division and was responsible for the Lincoln-Zephyr and Lincoln Continental. He introduced important features, such as hydraulic brakes, and greatly strengthened the company's overseas production. Ford was a major art benefactor in Detroit and also financed Admiral Richard Byrd's polar explorations. He died of stomach cancer aged 49, with his father resuming the presidency of the company, before handing it over to Henry Ford II. Life and career Edsel Ford was born in November 1893 in Detroit. He was the only child of Clara and Henry Ford, being named for Edsel Ruddiman, one of Henry Ford's closest childhood friends. He was groomed to take over the family automobile business, and grew up tinkering on cars with his father. He became secretary of Ford in 1915, and married Eleanor Lowthian Clay (1896–1976), the niece of department store owner J. L. Hudson, on November 1, 1916.   Together, they had four children: Henry Ford II (1917–1987), Benson Ford (1919–1978), Josephine Clay Ford (1923–2005),   and William Clay Ford (1925–2014).  1930 United States Census for Detroit, Michigan.

8ki3hhTSDQEdhYbVw3OOo3,Condoleezza Rice,261761089,"Condoleezza "" Condi "" Rice (  ; born November 14, 1954) is an American diplomat, political scientist, civil servant, and professor who is the current director of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. Rice served as the 66th United States Secretary of State from 2005 to 2009 and as the 20th United States National Security Advisor from 2001 to 2005. A member of the Republican Party, Rice was the first female African-American secretary of state and the first woman to serve as National Security Advisor. Until the election of Barack Obama as president in 2008, Rice and her predecessor, Colin Powell, were the highest-ranking African Americans in the history of the federal executive branch (by virtue of the secretary of state standing fourth in the presidential line of succession). Rice was born in Birmingham, Alabama, and grew up while the South was racially segregated. She obtained her bachelor's degree from the University of Denver and her master's degree in political science from the University of Notre Dame. In 1981 she received a PhD from the School of International Studies at the University of Denver.   She worked at the State Department under the Carter administration and served on the National Security Council as the Soviet and Eastern Europe Affairs Advisor to President George H. W. Bush during the dissolution of the Soviet Union and German reunification from 1989 to 1991. Rice later pursued an academic fellowship at Stanford University, where she later served as provost from 1993 to 1999. On December 17, 2000, she joined the Bush administration as President George W. Bush's National Security Advisor. In Bush's second term, she succeeded Colin Powell as Secretary of State. She was the second female secretary of state, after Madeleine Albright. Following her confirmation as Secretary of State, Rice pioneered the policy of Transformational Diplomacy directed toward expanding the number of responsible democratic governments in the world and especially in the Greater Middle East. That policy faced challenges as Hamas captured a popular majority in Palestinian elections, and influential countries including Saudi Arabia and Egypt maintained authoritarian systems (with U.S. backing). While in the position, she chaired the Millennium Challenge Corporation's board of directors.  In March 2009, Rice returned to Stanford University as a political science professor and the Thomas and Barbara Stephenson Senior Fellow on Public Policy at the Hoover Institution.   In September 2010, she became a faculty member of the Stanford Graduate School of Business and a director of its Global Center for Business and the Economy. In January 2020, it was announced that Rice would succeed Thomas W. Gilligan as the next director of the Hoover Institution on September 1, 2020. She is on the Board of Directors of Dropbox and Makena Capital Management, LLC.    Early life Rice was born in Birmingham, Alabama, the only child of Angelena (née Ray) Rice, a high school science, music, and oratory teacher, and John Wesley Rice, Jr., a high school guidance counselor, Presbyterian minister, and dean of students at Stillman College, a historically black college in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Her name, Condoleezza, derives from the music-related term con dolcezza, which in Italian means, "" with sweetness "" . Rice has roots in the American South going back to the pre-Civil War era, and some of her ancestors worked as sharecroppers for a time after emancipation. Rice discovered on the PBS series Finding Your Roots that she is of 51% African, 40% European, and 9% Asian or Native American genetic descent, while her mtDNA is traced back to the Tikar people of Cameroon.   In her 2017 book, , she writes, "" My great-great-grandmother Zina on my mother's side bore five children by different slave owners "" and "" My great-grandmother on my father's side, Julia Head, carried the name of the slave owner and was so favored by him that he taught her to read. "" Rice grew up in the Titusville neighborhood of Birmingham, and then Tuscaloosa, Alabama, at a time when the South was racially segregated. The Rices lived on the campus of Stillman College.","Birmingham, Alabama, U.S.",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condoleezza_Rice,,,,

8snwLR3jw3sdTPj74wT8Rw,Paul Brown,594363950,"Paul Eugene Brown (September 7, 1908 – August 5, 1991) was an American football coach and executive in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) and National Football League (NFL). Brown was both the co-founder and first coach of the Cleveland Browns, a team named after him, and later played a role in founding the Cincinnati Bengals. His teams won seven league championships in a professional coaching career spanning 25 seasons. Brown began his coaching career at Severn School in 1931 before becoming the head football coach at Massillon Washington High School in Massillon, Ohio, where he grew up. His high school teams lost only 10 games in 11 seasons. He was then hired at Ohio State University and coached the school to its first national football championship in 1942. After World War II, he became head coach of the Browns, who won all four AAFC championships before joining the NFL in 1950. Brown coached the Browns to three NFL championships – in 1950, 1954 and 1955 – but was fired in January 1963 amid a power struggle with team owner Art Modell. Brown in 1968 co-founded and was the first coach of the Bengals. He retired from coaching in 1975 but remained the Bengals' team president until his death in 1991. The Bengals named their home stadium Paul Brown Stadium in honor of Brown. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1967. Brown is credited with a number of American football innovations. He was the first coach to use game film to scout opponents, hire a full-time staff of assistants, and test players on their knowledge of a playbook. He invented the modern face mask, the practice squad and the draw play. He also played a role in breaking professional football's color barrier, bringing the first African-Americans to play pro football in the modern era onto his teams. Despite these accomplishments, Brown was not universally liked. He was strict and controlling, which often brought him into conflict with players who wanted a greater say in play-calling. These disputes, combined with Brown's failure to consult Modell on major personnel decisions, led to his firing as the Browns' coach in 1963.

He was formerly the President of the Asian Development Bank from 1 February 2005 to 18 March 2013.  Early life Kuroda attended University of Tokyo from 1963 to 1967, where he studied law and passed the bar examination before graduation. He joined the Ministry of Finance following graduation, and studied economics at Oxford University on a Japanese government scholarship from 1969 to 1971. He went on to hold various posts at the Ministry of Finance, culminating in the post of Vice Minister of Finance for International Affairs (1999-2003). He resigned from the ministry in January 2003 and was appointed Special Advisor to the Cabinet in March 2003. From 2005 to 2013, he served as president of the Asian Development Bank.  A summary of his role as president of the Asian Development Bank is in Peter McCawley, 2017, Banking on the Future of Asia and the Pacific: 50 Years of the Asian Development Bank, Manila: Asian Development Bank, pp. 272-273.  Bank of Japan governorship Kuroda has been an advocate of looser monetary policy in Japan. His February 2013 nomination by the incoming government of the Prime Minister Shinzō Abe had been expected. Also nominated at the same time were Kikuo Iwata – "" a harsh critic of past BOJ policies "" – and Hiroshi Nakaso, a senior BOJ official in charge of international affairs, as Kuroda's two deputies. The former governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, left in March 2013.  2013 "" There is plenty of room for monetary easing "" in Japan, Kuroda said in a February 2013 interview, adding that the BOJ could go beyond purchasing government bonds to include corporate bonds "" or even stocks "" . The yen, which "" has fallen 10% against the dollar since Abe began his campaign in November "" , also fell on the news of Kuroda's nomination. However, the new governor was "" expected to use his experience as Japan’s top currency official until 2003 to rebut that Tokyo is using easy monetary policy to drive the yen lower, triggering a war of competitive currency devaluation "" . . Bloomberg quoted Stephen Roach, a senior fellow at Yale University, as saying about Kuroda's goals: "" It’s a strong pledge from a well-intended man, but I’m not convinced it’s going to work. "" When Kuroda was asked the same question in his assumption of office's press conference on 21 March, Kuroda said the BOJ's role is to stabilize prices, and stabilizing exchange rates is the role of the Ministry of Finance.

Although there was opposition from developing countries, the policy was accepted by the other developed countries in the G20 summit. However, G20 members emphasized to Japanese policymakers that Japanese policy should be directed at domestic goals while highlighting the importance of a Japanese effort to reduce government debt.","Ōmuta, Fukuoka, Japan",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruhiko_Kuroda,,,,

9Ong1s6BGxudFSnfWZPz7I,Mark W. Parrish,62661198,"Mark Daniel Parrish (born February 2, 1977) is an American former professional ice hockey right winger. Parrish has played 11 seasons and over 700 games in the NHL with the Florida Panthers, New York Islanders, Los Angeles Kings, Minnesota Wild, Dallas Stars, Tampa Bay Lightning, and Buffalo Sabres. Playing career Parrish, a native of Bloomington, Minnesota, attended Bloomington Jefferson High School and won two high school State Championships with the Jaguars in 1993 and 1994. Upon graduating from high school, Parrish joined the St. Cloud State Huskies of the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA). After recording 30 points in 39 games as a freshman, Parrish was drafted in the third round, 79th overall, by the Colorado Avalanche in the 1996 NHL Entry Draft. Parrish returned to the St. Cloud for one more season, then decided to forgo his final two years of collegiate hockey to join the Seattle Thunderbirds of the Western Hockey League (WHL). A WHL West First All-Star in his only year of major junior, he scored at a goal-per-game pace with the Thunderbirds as team captain and accumulated 92 points in 54 games. Before he could appear in an NHL game, the Colorado Avalanche traded Parrish to the Florida Panthers along with a 3rd round selection in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft in exchange for veteran Tom Fitzgerald. He made his debut with the Panthers in 1998–99 and established himself as an effective power forward in the NHL, scoring 24 goals and 37 points as a rookie. After two seasons with the Panthers, Parrish was sent to the New York Islanders with left wing Oleg Kvasha in exchange for future superstars Roberto Luongo and Olli Jokinen. His production dipped to 17 goals and 30 points in his first season with the Islanders, before emerging with a career-high 30 goals, 30 assists and 60 points in 2001–02. His career-year also included an appearance in the 2002 NHL All-Star Game. In the off-season, he was re-signed to a two-year contract by the Islanders. Parrish continued to score in the 20-goal range and re-signed again with the Islanders following the 2003–04 season, but was inactive during 2004–05 due to the NHL lockout. When NHL play was set to resume the following season, Parrish signed another one-year contract worth $1.9 million on September 12, 2005.  At the 2005–06 trade deadline, he was dealt to the Los Angeles Kings along with Brent Sopel for Jeff Tambellini and Denis Grebeshkov. As his one-year contract expired at the end of that season, he became an unrestricted free agent on July 1, 2006, and signed with his home-state team, the Minnesota Wild to a five-year, $13.25 million contract. Parrish played two seasons with the Wild and was given the captaincy on three occasions as part of the team's monthly rotation. However, he could not match his previous production with the Islanders. On July 30, 2008, the final three years of Parrish's contract was bought out in order to clear salary cap space and he became a free agent.","Bloomington, Minnesota, U.S.",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Parrish,,,,

9w5mkLkzCJgcESdxruGcuK,Peter J. McDonnell,226897454,"Peter McDonnell (born 11 June 1953, Kendal, Westmorland, England) is an English former footballer goalkeeper who played professionally in England, the United States and Hong Kong. He began his professional career in 1973 with Bury, before being signed by Liverpool boss Bill Shankly after one year. He spent four years as reserve goalkeeper at Anfield, without making a first-team appearance. There were no substitute goalkeepers in domestic football in those days, and so McDonnell's only first-team squad involvement came in European football. He was on the bench for the 1977 European Cup Final, a game which Liverpool won. However, McDonnell's winner's medal was lost after the game, believed by some to have been stolen and given to one of Liverpool's first-team players who had missed the final. Following the arrival of Steve Ogrizovic, he was pushed down to third choice, and left to join Oldham Athletic in 1978. He spent four years there, before heading to Dallas in the NASL, then to Hong Kong to play for Hong Kong Rangers, eventually returning home to represent a number of non-league clubs. He spent some time at Barrow in the Northern Premier League, and later the Football Conference and won the FA Trophy at Wembley Stadium in 1990. McDonnell is currently a referee in the North Lancashire and District Football League and is a Westmorland Football Association council member.","Kendal, England",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_McDonnell,,,,

Cook is also a director of eBay and Procter & Gamble. Early life Cook holds a bachelor's degree in economics and mathematics from the University of Southern California and an MBA from Harvard Business School, where he serves on the dean's advisory board. Career Cook started his career at Procter & Gamble in Cincinnati, Ohio, where he learned about product development, market research, and marketing. He then took a job in strategic consulting at Bain & Company in Menlo Park, California. Cook soon began using the insights he was learning there to look for an idea for a company of his own. That idea came to him one day when his wife was complaining about paying the bills. With personal computers just coming out at the time, Scott thought there might be a market for basic software that would help people pay their bills. He launched Intuit in 1983, which today offers software and online products to help individuals and small companies manage their finances.",,en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Cook,Scott David Cook,,,< !--  or  -- >

A7vkh44NvRnerESv2Z0MEK,Jerome Lambert,24402173,"Joseph Jerome Lambert (May 29, 1971 – August 11, 2007) was an American expatriate basketball player who is best known for leading NCAA Division & nbsp;I in rebounding in 1993–94 while playing for Baylor. A , 215 pound power forward, Lambert accomplished the feat as a junior in his first season of Division & nbsp;I basketball. He had previously played for Westark Community College before enrolling at Baylor. During Lambert's recruitment to Baylor, then-assistant coach Gary Thomas had committed a major recruiting violation to acquire him. Thomas had faxed a term paper to Westark assistant basketball coach Troy Drummond on April 5, 1993, which was a slight re-write of an article that had previously appeared in a women's magazine. Lambert then handed the faxed paper in to an English class to pass it off as his own. He ultimately chose to play at Baylor, with Drummond "" coincidentally "" becoming a new assistant coach at that school, and news of this violation did not come out until after the 1993–94 season, the season in which Lambert's 14.8 & nbsp;rebounds per game led the NCAA.  He also garnered many accolades that season, including First Team All-Southwest Conference & nbsp;(SWC), SWC Newcomer of the Year, SWC All-Newcomer Team, one-time SWC Player of the Week and a three-time SWC Newcomer of the Week.  Due to the scandal, Lambert transferred to Oklahoma State, but because of NCAA transfer rules he had to sit out one full year before becoming eligible to play his final season. In his lone season with the Cowboys, he averaged 13.0 & nbsp;points and 6.6 & nbsp;rebounds per game. He then went on to play professionally in Israel before coming home to work for Danfoss and serve as a firefighter.  Lambert died at age 36 in Nevada County, Arkansas. He and his wife, Tracey L. Green, were both shot to death as a result of a verbal altercation between Lambert and another man. They had one son and one daughter together.

Early life and education He was born and raised in a Jewish family, the son of Florence and Charles Baker Schleifer,  New York Times: "" Paid Notice: Deaths SCHLEIFER, CHARLES BAKER December 4, 2011 in Queens, New York.  Forbes: "" Regeneron Chief Leonard Schleifer Becomes A Billionaire After 25 Year Search For New Drugs "" by Matthew Herper February 25, 2014 His father was a sweater manufacturer and World War II codebreaker. He graduated with a B.S. from Cornell University and a MD-PhD from the University of Virginia where he studied under future Nobel Laureate, Alfred G. Gilman. He then worked at New York Hospital where he trained to become a neurologist and also served as a junior faculty member.  Career Noticing that the biotechnology company Genentech was conducting state-of-the-art research but not on diseases of the nervous system, he determined to get into the biotechnology business. After rebuking Gilman's efforts to recruit him as an academic, he found a sponsor in George Sing, a venture capitalist at Merrill Lynch, and obtained $1 million in seed capital. He also recruited George Yancopoulos, a 28-year-old scientist, to be his partner, and in 1988 they founded Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. After several years of trying to recruit research doctors many of whom preferred to work in academia or for large corporations, they developed their first drug to treat Lou Gehrig’s disease. It was a failure as was their second drug to treat obesity. Thereafter, they invited the former Merck & Co. CEO Roy Vagelos to be the chairman of their company and to help to turn the company around. He implemented two strategic changes; only invest in drugs in which the biology of the disorder is fully understood; and do not underestimate the importance of human testing to ensure that what works in the laboratory will also work in the real world.  Eylea As CEO of Regeneron, Schleifer oversaw the "" approval and growth of high-priced drugs. "" In 2011, Regeneron's first successful drug was Eylea for age-related macular degeneration. Eylea prevented leaky blood vessels in the eye from causing blindness.  He licensed the drug to Aventis which was then bought by Sanofi which had no interest in the eye drug. Sanofi, in order to get out of its commitment, paid Regeneron $50 million and ceded the rights back to Regeneron. The drug was a blockbuster generating $838 million in its first full year and sales increased 55% to $1.3 billion in 2013 making Schleifer a billionaire. In 2014 Eylea grossed $1.735 billion.",,en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Schleifer,,,,

He is best known for his work and activism which led the German court in Lübeck to overturn a 1939 verdict from World War II, regarding the defenders of the Polish Post Office in Danzig (Gdańsk),  "" Dieter Schenk "" , profile at Web page of the city of Gdańsk, last accessed 3/29/2011 as well as his books on the widespread influence of ex-Nazis in post World War II Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA). Schenk is a former Kriminaldirektor of Federal Criminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt), located in Wiesbaden, where he was the agency's contact with Interpol. He left the agency in 1989 because of what he describes as "" the ignorance of the BKA concerning the violation of human rights in torturing regimes "" .  Schenk's CV  Work on the defense of Gdańsk post office  During the Nazi invasion of Poland, the Germans also carried out attacks on Polish controlled building in the Free City of Danzig (Wolne Miasto Gdańsk), including the post office, which constituted extraterritorial Polish property. The Polish defense of the building, carried out by 55 lightly armed postmen against more than 200 German SS (Schutzstaffel), SA (Sturmabteilung) and police troops, lasted for 15 hours. The Poles surrendered after the German forces used automatic pumps, gasoline tanks and flamethrowers to set the building on fire. Polish casualties were 6 killed during the fighting and 2 more killed while they were trying to surrender with a white flag. Four of the defenders managed to escape and six died in a Gestapo hospital. The rest were imprisoned, tortured, tried (with a single Wehrmacht officer as defense lawyer)  Dieter Schenk, Die Post von Danzig, page 96 by a Wehrmacht court-martial and sentenced to death. 28 of the judgements were countersigned, and thus became legally valid, by General Hans Günther von Kluge, another 10 by Colonel Eduard Wagner  Dieter Schenk, Die Post von Danzig, page 103 A clemency appeal was rejected by Walther von Brauchitsch  Dieter Schenk, Die Post von Danzig, page 106 (who was to be charged after the war with crimes against humanity, but died while in custody)  Mark Grossman, & pg=PA48 & dq=Brauchitsch+war+crimes & hl=en & ei=MTCMTc_0JPOJ0QGB0vWbCw & sa=X & oi=book_result & ct=result & resnum=1 & ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage & q=Brauchitsch%20war%20crimes & f=false World military leaders: a biographical dictionary, Infobase Publishing, 2007, pg. 48 and carried out on September 8 and 30.  Schenk began researching the events in 1993 and published a book, Die Post von Danzig: Geschichte eines deutschen Justizmords ( "" The Post Office of Gdańsk: History of a German judicial murder "" ), which led to the revision of the verdict. He figured out that the German forces were Danzig police-, SS- and SA-men, commanded by a Danzig police officer, and only at a subsequent stage regular Wehrmacht forces did take part in the fighting. Thus a Wehrmacht court martial was not competent to convict the defenders. Instead, the Free City of Danzig's penal law would have been applicable, without the alternative of a death penalty. As a result, the judgements were nullified and the Polish defenders were "" rehabilitated "" by the Lübeck court. A symbolic reparation was made to the victims' families. On their initiative, Schenk was declared an honorary citizen of Gdańsk in 2003.",Frankfurt am Main,en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Schenk,,,,

He sat as Member of Parliament for Devizes from 1964 until 1992. Early life Morrison was the son of John Morrison, a Wiltshire landowner and Conservative Member of Parliament who was later ennobled as Baron Margadale (entitling his son to the honorific "" The Honourable "" ), and was educated at Eton. Morrison was the brother of Peter Morrison, who became member of parliament for Chester, while his sister, Dame Mary Morrison, has been a Woman of the Bedchamber to Queen Elizabeth II for over fifty years. "" Her Majesty's A-team "" The Daily Telegraph  Morrison's great-great-grandfather James Morrison created the family's great fortune by stockpiling black crepe fabric in readiness for the mourning of King William IV in 1837, becoming known as "" the richest commoner in the Empire "" . In the 1830s, he circumvented high tariffs on pairs of gloves by importing right-handed gloves through Yarmouth, Isle of Wight, and left-handed ones through Southampton. After Eton and National Service in the Life Guards, Morrison went up to Cambridge for two years, but left, explaining later that "" I was just wasting my time and didn't feel like a third year... But I did leave voluntarily. "" He then trained at the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester, before starting work on managing the family estates.  Career In 1958, Morrison became a member of Wiltshire County Council and chaired its Education Committee in 1963–1964.

From 2013 to 2018 he was on the board of Telia Company. Since April 2019 he has been an expert on Sweden's immigrants' integration issues for the Moderate Party commission New Swedish Model. Career As a student at the Särlaskolan primary school in Borås, Lorentzon told classmates that he wanted to sell one matchbox to every Chinese person and become a billionaire. In high school he attended the technical department of Sven Eriksonsgymnasiet, where he liked to go to parties but always put education first: if there was a party before a test he would lie that he was sick and would have to stay home.  In 1990 Lorentzon began his studies at the Chalmers University of Technology where he studied industrial economics and later finished with a master of science and engineering degree. He attended economics courses at the Gothenburg School of Business, Economics and Law. Lorentzon also studied economics at the Stockholm School of Economics and took courses in rhetoric and argumentation at Stockholm University.  In 1995 Lorentzon started an internship at a telephone company, Telia. He moved to San Francisco and worked in the AltaVista office there. In Silicon Valley he met skilled web entrepreneurs and found a job at a investment company called Cell Ventures, where he met Felix Hagnö, the son of the owners of a Swedish clothing line called Joy. In September 1999 Lorentzon and Hagnö founded Netstrategy, which would later become the leading European marketplace Tradedoubler. The company soon became commercially profitable and socially acclaimed: in 2001 it won the Swedish Guldmusen prize for "" IT-rookie of the Year "" ,   the Swedish Trade Council in the United Kingdom prize "" Achievement Award "" in 2002 for Swedish companies that have been the most successful in the UK over the past year, and the Swedish "" Export Hermes "" prize in 2004 for the best Swedish exporting company. Lorentzon then moved to Germany. Web sales peaked and in 2005 he sold his Tradedoubler option for US$70 million. He admitted the role of luck in this success. Lorentzon moved back to Sweden after ten years abroad. In March 2006 Tradedoubler bought advertising service Advertigo, created by Daniel Ek. Ek and Lorentzon quickly became friends, finding that they had common experiences of depression because of unexpected wealth and a lack of purpose. From April 2013 — March 2018 Lorentzon served as a member of the board of directors at Telia, where he also owned 230,000 shares. He is an investor in student.com, a service that helps students find accommodation.","Åsenhöga, Småland, Sweden",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Lorentzon,,,,

She is the chief brand officer (CBO) of WWE and appears as an authority figure on the Raw, NXT and SmackDown brands. She is a fourth generation wrestling promoter as a member of the McMahon family, she has worked for WWE since she was a young girl (modeling T-shirts and other merchandise for various WWE catalogs) working her way up to receptionist, then in various front office jobs up to and including her current CBO position. She is the great-granddaughter of Roderick "" Jess "" McMahon, granddaughter of Vincent J. McMahon, daughter of WWE Chairman and CEO Vincent K. McMahon and retired WWE CEO and former Administrator of the Small Business Administration Linda McMahon, the younger sister of WWE part-owner/wrestler Shane McMahon, and wife of WWE executive/wrestler Paul "" Triple H "" Levesque. McMahon began appearing regularly on-air for WWE (then WWF as the World Wrestling Federation) in 1999 as a part of a storyline with The Undertaker. After a brief on-screen relationship with Test, she was engaged to Triple H — whom she married both on-screen and later in real life — which resulted in The McMahon-Helmsley Faction storyline. She has held the WWF Women's Championship once. In 2001, she was the on-screen owner of Extreme Championship Wrestling during The Invasion. The following year, she was the SmackDown General Manager, but stopped appearing regularly on television after an "" I Quit "" match with her father Vince McMahon. After making only sporadic appearances for several years, McMahon began appearing regularly on Raw in 2008 as the Raw brand general manager before disappearing once again. By mid-2013, McMahon returned to regular on-air appearances in the WWE, this time under the gimmick of an unctuous, judgmental, bullying owner along with on-screen chief operating officer, her husband, Triple H. From 2013 to 2016, they acted as a power couple known as The Authority, making what were often shady decrees while claiming only to be concerned for "" what's best for business, "" all the while romanticizing each other in the process with public displays of affection. The Authority later expanded into a stable, co-led by Triple H and herself. Early life Stephanie Marie McMahon was born on September 24, 1976 in Hartford, Connecticut to Linda and Vince McMahon.  Peterson Kaelberer, Angie. The McMahons, 17 She has one brother, Shane McMahon. Soon after her birth, the family moved to Greenwich, Connecticut.

After graduating from Greenwich High School in 1994, she attended Boston University and in 1998 earned a degree in Communications. After graduating in 1998, she began working for the WWF full-time.

VETcoz2eEF3dFbChNU8mUR,Anne Sutherland Fuchs,656919,"Anne Fuchs,  is an academic specialist on modern and post-war German literature and Culture. Career Fuchs studied German and English Literature at the University of Konstanz, obtaining her M.A. in 1988 and her doctorate in 1991. Her doctoral dissertation on humour in the prose of the Swiss writer Robert Walser was published as Dramaturgie des Narrentums. Das Komische in der Prosa Robert Walsers (Munich, Fink, 1993). Her research addresses German cultural memory since 1945, German literature in the 20th and 21st centuries, German-Jewish literature, modernism, and the experience of time and temporality in modern culture. For a number of years she has been particularly concerned with “German memory contests”, i.e. a series of intensely fought public debates about German cultural identity in the aftermath of the Holocaust, World War II and unification. The growing distance to the Nazi past and unification have led to a new memory contest that concerns the legacy of the GDR and of the old Federal Republic in the context of globalisation. She went on to work at University College London, and from 1992 to 2010 at University College Dublin, where she became Professor of Modern German Literature and Culture. She moved to the University of St Andrews in 2011 and then to the University of Warwick, as Professor of German Studies, in 2012.

Later he sold toys and beauty products on the streets of New York City, which eventually evolved into selling surplus stock and end-of-line items at a big profit. Although he never attended a university, he taught himself how to read a balance sheet and became very good at spotting overlooked value in weak and distressed companies.  Career Revco With a new partner, Bernard Marden, and leveraging the skills he attained as a wholesaler, he formed a company called Odd Lot Trading, a wholesaler and retailer of closeout items. In May 1984, they sold Odd Lot to Revco Discount Drug Stores in exchange for 12% of Revco stock. He soon challenged Revco management for control of the company but, after initial positive feedback, was rejected.

VQ2RPGOhwlEbn7PcsFD3uE,William Clay Ford,21877771,"William Clay "" Bill "" Ford Jr. (born May 3, 1957) is an American businessman, serving as executive chairman of Ford Motor Company. The great-grandson of company founder Henry Ford, Ford joined the board in 1988 and has served as chairman since January 1999.   Ford also served as the president, CEO, and COO until turning over those roles to former Boeing executive Alan Mulally in September 2006.   Ford is also the vice chairman of the Detroit Lions NFL franchise.  Ford serves as a chairman of the United States-Mexico Chamber of Commerce. He holds a B.A. degree from Princeton University and a M.S. degree from MIT. Early life and education Ford was born in Detroit, Michigan, the great-grandson of Henry Ford and great-grandson of Harvey S. Firestone. His father was William Clay Ford Sr. and his mother is Martha Firestone. On his mother's side, his grandparents are Harvey S. Firestone Jr. and Elizabeth Parke. On his father's side, his grandparents are Edsel Ford and Eleanor Lowthian Clay. Edsel Ford II, son of Henry Ford II and also a board member, is his first cousin. Ford has three sisters: Martha Morse (who has 3 children), Sheila Hamp (who has 3 children), and Elizabeth Kontulis. He, like his great-grandfather Henry Ford, is of mainly Irish, English, and Belgian descent. Ford graduated from the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut in 1975. He then attended Princeton University and graduated with an A.B. in history in 1979 after completing a 105-page long senior thesis titled "" Henry Ford and Labor: A Reappraisal. "" While a student at Princeton, Ford was president of the Ivy Club and played on the Princeton rugby team. In 1984 he received an M.S. in management as a Sloan Fellow from the MIT Sloan School of Management.  Career He joined Ford in 1979 and 1981 held a variety of positions, beginning in product development and on the financial staff, a grooming ground for future executives. He served several years as a mid-ranking executive in product development. He also briefly headed the Climate Control Division (since divested from the company as part of the Visteon spinoff). At the time of the Ford 2000 reorganization, he was in charge of heavy truck operations. Corporate governance Ford gave up an executive position in heavy truck program management to become chairman of the finance committee on the board of directors, a non-executive corporate governance position. He was elected chairman of the board in September 1998 and took office on January 1, 1999. Ford added the title of chief executive officer on October 30, 2001, following the ouster of then-CEO Jacques Nasser. That ouster reflected significant differences in corporate values—Nasser focused on maximizing corporate profits and shareholder value, while Ford was noted for valuing people and tradition . With the retirement of Ford president and chief operating officer Jim Padilla in April 2006, Bill Ford assumed those roles as well. On September 5, 2006, Ford announced that he was stepping down as president and CEO, naming former Boeing senior executive Alan Mulally as his replacement. Ford continues as the company's executive chairman.","Detroit, Michigan, U.S.",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Clay_Ford_Jr.,William Clay Ford Jr.,,,

Until 2020, he was CEO of International Airlines Group, and had previously been CEO of Aer Lingus and British Airways.  Early life Walsh was born in Dublin, Ireland. He attended his local secondary school Ardscoil Rís. At age 17 he became a pilot at Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus, joining as a cadet in 1979. He acquired a Master's degree in management and business administration from Trinity College, Dublin during his pilot years, while advancing to become a Boeing 737 captain.  AW & ST, 24 March 2014, p. 46  He joined company management in various positions including chief executive of then company subsidiary, Futura from 1998 to 2000. He returned to Aer Lingus in 2000 as Chief Operating Officer (COO). Career In October 2001, Walsh was elevated from COO to CEO of Aer Lingus, succeeding Michael Foley who had resigned following a harassment complaint.   The carrier was in financial difficulty. Walsh eliminated 2,000 staff positions and reconfigured Aer Lingus as a low-cost airline. He also withdrew various services like short-haul Business Class and restricted the airline's frequent-flyer programme, TAB. The company operating profits rebounded, but the cost of the write-offs and redundancies meant that net profitability was not as quick to recover. Not all of Walsh's reforms were successful, such as the outsourcing of aircraft cleaning. The contracting had not been agreed with Aer Lingus unions which led to large payments to the private contractor while Aer Lingus employees did the cleaning work. A three-day lock-out occurred in 2002 during the peak of the cutbacks.","Dublin, Ireland",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Walsh_(businessman),William Matthew Walsh,,,

WEMOIXlglWMcqTYo1Q5a1d,Leon Levine,270823,"Leon Levine (born June 8, 1937) is an American businessman and philanthropist. He founded the Family Dollar chain of discount stores. Early life Leon Levine was born to a Jewish family on June 8, 1937 in Wadesboro, North Carolina. The family actually lived in Rockingham, North Carolina but the town had no hospital. The family ran a small town store called The Hub. His brother Sherman and his mother ran the Hub until it closed in 1960. In 1949, when Levine was 12, his father died from a heart attack. The loss led him to become closer to his mother. In 1951, his brother Sherman was drafted to serve with the military in Korea, which left Leon to take on more responsibilities at the store. He would go to school in the morning and work in the afternoon. Career In 1956 Leon and Sherman purchased a chenille bedspread factory in Wingate, North Carolina. He attended nearby Wingate College during the day so he could run the factory after classes. After a discouraging sales trip to New York, Leon kept at and was able to find a market for his bedspreads in Puerto Rico. In 1958, Levine, realizing he had to make a major capital investment in new equipment to stay competitive, sold the company. In 1959 he visited a store in Kentucky that sold nothing for over a dollar. He liked the concept and in November 1959, at age 22, he opened up a similar store in the 1500 block of Central Avenue in Charlotte that sold items for no more than $2. He named it Family Dollar for the affordability of its products and the demographic that it was aimed towards. Levine began Family Dollar with $3,000 of his own money and $3,000 from a partner.","Wadesboro, North Carolina",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Levine,,,,

WI0caxhKHnVc1GbwKKhHDD,Warren E. Buffett,255254,"Warren Edward Buffett (  ; born August 30, 1930) is an American business magnate, investor, and philanthropist. He is currently the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. He is considered one of the most successful investors in the world   and has a net worth of over $100.6 & nbsp;billion as of April 2021, making him the world's seventh-wealthiest person.  Buffett was born in Omaha, Nebraska. He developed an interest in business and investing in his youth, eventually entering the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1947 before transferring to and graduating from the University of Nebraska at 19. He went on to graduate from Columbia Business School, where he molded his investment philosophy around the concept of value investing pioneered by Benjamin Graham. He attended New York Institute of Finance to focus his economics background and soon after began various business partnerships, including one with Graham. He created Buffett Partnership, Ltd in 1956 and his firm eventually acquired a textile manufacturing firm called Berkshire Hathaway, assuming its name to create a diversified holding company. In 1978, Charlie Munger joined Buffett as vice-chairman.  Buffett has been the chairman and largest shareholder of Berkshire Hathaway since 1970. He has been referred to as the "" Oracle "" or "" Sage "" of Omaha by global media.   He is noted for his adherence to value investing, and his personal frugality despite his immense wealth. Research published at the University of Oxford characterizes Buffett's investment methodology as falling within "" founder centrism "" , defined by a deference to managers with a founder's mindset, an ethical disposition towards the shareholder collective, and an intense focus on exponential value creation. Essentially, Buffett's concentrated investments shelter managers from the short-term pressures of the market. ( "" From the perspective of founder centrism, 3G Capital's private equity control position in publicly traded companies is conceptually akin to Berkshire Hathaway's management-friendly disposition. Both acquire concentrated positions with a focus on long-term business fundamentals, a disinclination towards discriminatory costs, and an ethical disposition towards fellow shareholders "" .)  Buffett is a notable philanthropist, having pledged to give away 99 percent of his fortune to philanthropic causes, primarily via the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. He founded The Giving Pledge in 2009 with Bill Gates, whereby billionaires pledge to give away at least half of their fortunes.","Omaha, Nebraska, U.S.",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett,Warren Edward Buffett,,,

He formerly served as the chief financial officer of American financial services company Merrill Lynch and briefly as Bank of America's president for the Asia-Pacific region.   He is the former president of CIT Group and reported directly to then CEO John Thain. On August 21, 2018, it was announced that Chai has been hired as the chief financial officer of Uber.  Career Chai served in senior positions at AlliedSignal and Philip Morris before joining medical diagnostics products manufacturer Dade Behring in 1997 as corporate vice president of worldwide field finance; he later became their senior vice president of business development.  Archipelago Chai was named chief financial officer of Chicago, Illinois-based electronic communication network company Archipelago Exchange in June 2000. Chai was a major driving force behind the merger between Archipelago and the New York Stock Exchange; he repeatedly pressured his boss Archipelago CEO Gerald Putnam, to meet with NYSE officials, though Putnam felt that the NYSE would be uninterested and hoped instead to pursue an acquisition of rival ECN Instinet. In April 2005, when Archipelago formally announced its pending acquisition by the NYSE, it was decided that Chai would take over as CFO of the NYSE in May 2006 from Amy Butte, who had held that position since February 2004. Butte later decided to leave the exchange entirely rather than continue at her planned new position as executive vice president of strategy and product development. In 2006, Chai received a salary of $750,000 and a bonus of $825,000 from the NYSE; combined with other payments, his cash compensation for the year totalled $2,168,922.  Merrill Lynch On 3 December 2007, John Thain, the new chief executive officer at Merrill Lynch and Chai's former boss at the NYSE, announced that Chai would join Merrill in the position of chief financial officer starting on 10 December; the move was part of a management shake-up at Merrill, initiated due to their losses in the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis. Chai replaced Jeffrey Edwards, who had held the position of CFO since 2005; Thain stated Edwards would assume another unspecified role within Merrill. Chai's new employer revealed that he would receive a bonus of $2.5 million for the 2007 fiscal year, split evenly between cash and stock, for his three weeks of work that year, bringing his total compensation for the year to $3.1 million.   Merrill justified the bonus by pointing out that Chai would not receive any year-end incentive payment from his previous employer. Chai was slated to receive a salary of $600,000 in 2008. However, he and other top-level Merrill executives received no bonus that year, due to the ongoing financial crisis.",,en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Chai,,,,

WMzEnPekbDIct3OhNNPLtt,Sumner Redstone,,"Sumner Murray Redstone ( Rothstein; May 27, 1923 – August 11, 2020) was an American billionaire businessman and media magnate. He is the founder and chairman of the second incarnation of Viacom which was dissolved in 2019 (a year before Redstone's death) and was the majority owner and chairman of the National Amusements theater chain. Through National Amusements, Redstone, up until his death, was, and his family remains, majority voting shareholder of mass media conglomerate ViacomCBS, in turn, the parent company of the Paramount Pictures film studio, the CBS television network, and various cable networks. According to Forbes, as of April 2020, he was worth US$2.6 billion.  Redstone was formerly the executive chairman of both CBS and Viacom.   In February 2016, at age 92, Redstone resigned both chairmanships following a court-ordered examination by a geriatric psychiatrist. He was ultimately succeeded by Les Moonves at CBS and Philippe Dauman at Viacom.  Early life and education Redstone was born to a Jewish family in Boston, Massachusetts, to Belle (née Ostrovsky) and Michael Rothstein. In 1940, his father changed the family surname from "" Rothstein "" to "" Redstone "" ( "" Red stone "" is the translation of the Yiddish name, "" Rothstein "" ).   Michael Rothstein owned Northeast Theater Corporation in Dedham, Massachusetts (the forerunner of National Amusements)  Weddings/Celebrations: Paula Fortunato, Sumner M. Redstone , The New York Times, April 6, 2003 and the Boston branch of the Latin Quarter Nightclub.  Redstone attended the Boston Latin School, from which he graduated first in his class. In 1944, he graduated from Harvard College, where he completed the studies for his bachelor's degree in three years. Later, Redstone served as a 1st Lieutenant in the United States Army during World War II with a team at the Signals Intelligence Service  that decoded Japanese messages.  Cf. "" The Highwaymen "" by Ken Auletta. Auletta also wrote that Redstone finished his Harvard undergraduate degree in two and a half years. After his military service, he worked in Washington, D.C., and attended Georgetown University Law Center. He transferred to Harvard Law School and received his law degree in 1947.  After completing law school, Redstone served as special assistant to U.S. Attorney General Tom C. Clark (who later served as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1949 to 1967) and then worked for the United States Department of Justice Tax Division in Washington, D.C. and San Francisco, and thereafter entered private practice. In 1954, he joined his father's theater chain, National Amusements and in 1967, he became CEO of the company. As the company grew, Redstone came to believe that content would become more important than distribution mechanisms: channels of distribution (in varied forms) would always exist, but content would always be essential (Redstone coined the phrase, "" Content is king! "" ) He invested in Columbia Pictures, 20th Century Fox, Orion Pictures, and Paramount Pictures (Redstone's Viacom would buy Paramount in the 1990s), all of which turned over huge profits when he chose to sell their stock in the early 1980s.","Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumner_Redstone,Sumner Murray Rothstein,"Los Angeles, California, U.S. < ref >  < /ref >",,

WkDxkuTozjMaglDsee1X71,John P. Webster,27653470,"John Webster ( – ) was an English Jacobean dramatist best known for his tragedies The White Devil and The Duchess of Malfi, which are often regarded as masterpieces of the early 17th-century English stage. His life and career overlapped Shakespeare's. Biography Webster's life is obscure and the dates of his birth and death are not known. His father, a carriage maker also named John Webster, married a blacksmith's daughter named Elizabeth Coates on 4 November 1577 and it is likely that Webster was born not long after in or near London. The family lived in St. Sepulchre's parish. His father John and his Uncle Edward were Freemen of the Merchant Taylors' Company and Webster attended Merchant Taylors' School in Suffolk Lane, London.  "" John Webster also attended the school, though probably after Mulcaster's retirement in 1586 "" , Julia Briggs, This Stage Play World – Texts & Contexts 1580–1625, OUP, p. 196. On 1 August 1598, "" John Webster, lately of the New Inn "" was admitted to the Middle Temple, one of the Inns of Court; in view of the legal interests evident in his dramatic work, this may be the playwright.  Webster married 17-year-old Sara Peniall on 18 March 1605 at St Mary's Church, Islington.  Rene Weis, editor of John Webster: The Duchess of Malfi and Other Plays (Oxford World's Classics, 1996) in programme notes for The Duchess of Malfi, The Old Vic, Spring 2012 A special licence had to be obtained to permit a wedding in Lent, which was necessary as Sara was seven months pregnant.

XMjeaHLCSazdbLwjEhlmsg,William A. Albrecht,,"William Albert Albrecht (September 12, 1888 – May 19, 1974)  Springerlink, Obituary of William A. Albrecht, 1974  chairman of the Department of Soils at the University of Missouri, was the foremost authority on the relation of soil fertility to human health and earned four degrees from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. As emeritus professor of soils at the University of Missouri, he saw a direct link between soil quality, food quality and human health. He drew direct connections between poor quality forage crops, and ill health in livestock and from this developed a formula for ideal ratios of cations in the soil, the Base Cation Saturation Ratio. While he did not discover cation exchange in the soil as is sometimes supposed, he may have been the first to associate it with colloidal clay particles. He served as 1939 President of the Soil Science Society of America.  Soil Sci. Soc. Am. J. 75:1179–1188 doi:10.2136/sssaj2010.0107pres_and_yearly_reports Twenty years before the phrase 'environmental concern' crept into the national consciousness, he was lecturing from coast to coast on the broad topic of agricultural ecology. (C. Edmund Marshall, In Memoriam, 'Plant and Soil' vol 48.)  Early life William Albrecht was born of German ancestry on a farm on the prairie of north central Illinois in the Mid-West United States. After attending the local school he progressed via preparatory school to the University of Illinois where he obtained a B.A. degree in liberal arts. This led to a position teaching Latin and other subjects at Bluffton University, Ohio.  Albrecht later returned to Illinois to gain a B.S. degree in biology and agricultural science. He then started graduate research in Botany whilst also teaching in the department of botany. This period was key to his lifelong devotion to scientific study of plant physiology and agriculture. It enabled him to take a microbiological view of plant structure whilst addressing the soil as a variable environment (either favourable or unsuitable). He presented his doctoral research in 1919, and it was published in the journal Soil Science in 1920 titled 'Symbiotic nitrogen fixation as influenced by nitrogen in the soil' His paper concluded that the nitrogen level in soil had no significant effect on fixation by legumes.","Illinois, United States",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Albrecht,,"Columbia, Missouri, United States",1888,"1974, aged 85"

XR9VHrfiOamaUi7ep91LRv,Benjamin Silbermann,248408628,"Ben Silbermann (born July 14, 1982) is an American billionaire Internet entrepreneur. He is the co-founder and CEO of Pinterest, a social media network and self-described 'visual discovery engine,' which lets users organize images, links, recipes and other things. Early life Silbermann was born in 1982. He was raised in Des Moines, Iowa. His parents, Jane Wang and Neil Silbermann, are ophthalmologists with a family practice still based in his native city.  In 1998, Silbermann attended the Research Science Institute at MIT. Subsequently, he graduated from Des Moines Central Academy and Des Moines Roosevelt with the class of 1999. He then graduated from Yale University in the spring of 2003 with a degree in political science.  Career Before Pinterest (which launched in March 2010), Silbermann worked at Google in the online advertising group. However, after a short time with the company he left and started designing his own iPhone apps with a college friend, Paul Sciarra. After their initial application, Tote, failed to gain significant traction, the cofounders teamed up with Evan Sharp to create a pinboard product that would eventually be named Pinterest. Silbermann says that the genesis of Pinterest really came from his love of collecting as a kid. "" Collecting tells a lot about who you are, "" he said, and when they looked at the web "" there wasn't a place to share that side of who you were. "" A little over nine years after starting Pinterest, the company held its IPO in April 2019 which valued the company around 12 billion dollars beating expectations. Personal life Silbermann is married to Divya Bhaskaran, with whom he has two children. He resides in San Francisco, California. According to Forbes, he is worth an estimated $3.4 billion as of May 8, 2021.  References",,en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Silbermann,,,,

XX07p5AGWWkecaRv2U4zbT,Charles W. Hull,308411,"Chuck Hull (Charles W. Hull; born May 12, 1939) is the co-founder, executive vice president and chief technology officer of 3D Systems.  & ticker=DDD:US Businessweek Executive Profile  He is one of the inventors of the SLA 3D printer, the first commercial rapid prototyping technology, and the widely used STL file format. He is named on more than 60 U.S. patents as well as other patents around the world in the fields of ion optics and rapid prototyping. He was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2014 and in 2017 was one of the first inductees into the TCT Hall of Fame.  Early life Chuck Hull was born on May 12, 1939 in Clifton, Colorado, the son of Lester and Esther Hull. His early life was spent in Clifton and Gateway, Colorado. He graduated from Central High School in Grand Junction, Colorado. Chuck received a BS in engineering physics from the University of Colorado in 1961.  Beginnings of stereolithography Hull first came up with the idea in 1983 when he was using UV light to harden tabletop coatings. But on July 16, 1984 Alain Le Méhauté, Olivier de Witte and Jean Claude André filed their patent for the stereolithography process. It was three weeks before Chuck Hull filed his own patent for stereolithography. The application of French inventors were abandoned by the French General Electric Company (now Alcatel-Alsthom) and CILAS (The Laser Consortium). The claimed reason was “for lack of business perspective”. Hull coined the term “stereolithography” in his  entitled “Apparatus for Production of Three-Dimensional Objects by Stereolithography” issued on March 11, 1986.  & printsec=abstract & source=gbs_overview_r & cad=0#v=onepage & q & f=false U.S. Patent 4,575,330 (“Apparatus for Production of Three-Dimensional Objects by Stereolithography”)  He defined stereolithography as a method and apparatus for making solid objects by successively “printing” thin layers of the ultraviolet curable material one on top of the other.  In Hull's patent, a concentrated beam of ultraviolet light is focused onto the surface of a vat filled with liquid photopolymer. The light beam, moving under computer control, draws each layer of the object onto the surface of the liquid. Wherever the beam strikes the surface, the photopolymer polymerizes/crosslinks and changes to a solid. An advanced CAD/CAM/CAE software mathematically slices the computer model of the object into a large number of thin layers. The process then builds the object layer by layer starting with the bottom layer, on an elevator that is lowered slightly after solidification of each layer.  Commercial rapid prototyping In 1986, commercial rapid prototyping was started by Hull when he founded 3D Systems in Valencia, California. Hull realized that his concept was not limited to liquids and therefore gave it the generic name “stereolithography” (3D printing),  History of 3D  and filed broad patent claims covering any “material capable of solidification” or “material capable of altering its physical state.” Hull built up a patent portfolio covering many fundamental aspects of today's additive manufacturing technologies such as data preparation via triangulated models (STL file format) and slicing, and exposure strategies such as alternating hatch directions.

XtrVuQAXNEaccPjwKhLwgZ,William Spence,,"William Guthrie Spence (7 August 1846 – 13 December 1926), Australian trade union leader and politician, played a leading role in the formation of both Australia's largest union, the Australian Workers' Union, and the Australian Labor Party. Early life Spence was born on the island of Eday in the Orkney Islands, Scotland, the son of a stonemason, and migrated to Australia with his family as a six-year-old child. He had no formal education and worked as a farm labourer in the Wimmera district of Victoria from the age of 13. Later he acquired a gold-mining licence and worked for various mining companies. In 1871 he married Ann Jane Savage.  In 1874 Spence was one of a number of militant mine-workers who formed the Amalgamated Miners' Association of Victoria, and he became the union's general secretary in 1882. He led the union into mergers with similar unions in the other Australian colonies, forming the Amalgamated Miners' Association of Australasia. In 1886, he became the first president of the Australian Shearers' Union; he also became president of its successor, the Amalgamated Shearers' Union of Australasia in 1887, and by 1890 most shearers in South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales had joined the union and 85 per cent of the shearing sheds were open to union members only.  Since the Australian economy was expanding rapidly at this time and there was an acute shortage of labour, the unions were in a strong bargaining position and were able to secure great improvements in the living standards of Australia's rural working class. But the Depression which began in 1891 led to acute class conflict as the mine owners and graziers tried to cut wages to remain solvent in the face of falling commodity prices, and the unions resisted. In 1894 Spence led the amalgamation of the miners, shearers and other rural workers into the Australian Workers' Union (AWU), Australia's largest and most powerful union. There were bitter strikes in the maritime and pastoral industries, in which Spence played a leading role, although he was generally a force for moderation in the labour movement. He was the AWU's secretary from 1894 to 1898 and president from 1898 to 1917.","Eday, Scotland",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Spence,,"Terang, Victoria",,

He continued to impress, and was named as PFA Young Player of the Year in 1984. He moved to Liverpool for a £700,000 fee in May 1984, and was named in the PFA Team of the Year in his debut season for the club as Liverpool won the league title and the Football League Super Cup. He went on to struggle with injury at Anfield, though still managed to appear in losing finals of the 1984 FA Charity Shield, 1984 European Super Cup, 1985 European Cup, and 1987 Football League Cup, as well as help Liverpool to the league title and FA Cup double in 1985–86, and to finish as runners-up in the league in 1984–85 and 1986–87.

He was also chairman of Tata Group, from 1990 to 2012, and again, as interim chairman, from October 2016 through February 2017, and continues to head its charitable trusts.   He is the recipient of two of the highest civilian awards of India, the Padma Vibhushan (2008) and Padma Bhushan (2000).  Born in 1937, he is a scion of the Tata family, and son of Naval Tata who was later adopted by Ratanji Tata, son of Jamsetji Tata, the founder of Tata Group. He is an alumnus of the Cornell University College of Architecture and Harvard Business School through the Advanced Management Program that he completed in 1975.  He joined his company in 1961 when he used to work on the shop floor of Tata Steel, and was the apparent successor to J. R. D. Tata upon the latter's retirement in 1991. He got Tata Tea to acquire Tetley, Tata Motors to acquire Jaguar Land Rover, and Tata Steel to acquire Corus, in an attempt to turn Tata from a largely India-centrist group into a global business. Early life Ratan Tata was born in Bombay, now Mumbai, on 28 December 1937, and is the son of Naval Tata (born in Surat). His biological maternal grandmother had been the sister of Hirabai Tata, wife of group founder Jamshedji Tata. His biological grandfather, Hormusji Tata, had belonged to the broader Tata family; Ratan therefore was a Tata by birth. Parents Naval and Sonoo separated in 1948 when Ratan was 10, and he was subsequently raised by the widow of Sir Ratanji Tata, his grandmother, Navajbai Tata, who formally adopted him through the J. N. Petit Parsi Orphanage. He has a half-brother, Noel Tata (from Naval Tata's second marriage with Simone Tata), with whom he was raised. His first language is Gujarati.

ZAbGY8KxnRle7kcrdBOi0A,Robert D. Johnson,556288640,"Robert Leroy Johnson (May 8, 1911 August 16, 1938) was an American blues guitarist, singer, and songwriter. His landmark recordings in 1936 and 1937 display a combination of singing, guitar skills, and songwriting talent that has influenced later generations of musicians. He is now recognized as a master of the blues, particularly the Delta blues style. As a traveling performer who played mostly on street corners, in juke joints, and at Saturday night dances, Johnson had little commercial success or public recognition in his lifetime. He participated in only two recording sessions, one in San Antonio in 1936, and one in Dallas in 1937, that produced 29 distinct songs (with 13 surviving alternate takes) recorded by famed Country Music Hall of Fame producer Don Law. These songs, recorded at low fidelity in improvised studios, were the totality of his recorded output. Most were released as 10-inch, 78 rpm singles from , with a few released after his death. Other than these recordings, very little was known of him during his life outside of the small musical circuit in the Mississippi Delta where he spent most of his life; much of his story has been reconstructed after his death by researchers. Johnson's poorly documented life and death have given rise to much legend. The one most closely associated with his life is that he sold his soul to the devil at a local crossroads to achieve musical success. His music had a small, but influential, following during his life and in the two decades after his death. In late 1938 John Hammond sought him out for a concert at Carnegie Hall, From Spirituals to Swing, only to discover that Johnson had died. Brunswick Records, which owned the original recordings, was bought by Columbia Records, where Hammond was employed. Musicologist Alan Lomax went to Mississippi in 1941 to record Johnson, also not knowing of his death. Law, who by then worked for Columbia Records, assembled a collection of Johnson's recordings titled King of the Delta Blues Singers that was released by Columbia in 1961. It is widely credited with finally bringing Johnson's work to a wider audience. The album would become influential, especially on the nascent British blues movement; Eric Clapton has called Johnson "" the most important blues singer that ever lived. ""  Musicians such as Bob Dylan, Keith Richards, and Robert Plant have cited both Johnson's lyrics and musicianship as key influences on their own work. Many of Johnson's songs have been covered over the years, becoming hits for other artists, and his guitar licks and lyrics have been borrowed by many later musicians. Renewed interest in Johnson's work and life led to a burst of scholarship starting in the 1960s. Much of what is known about him was reconstructed by researchers such as Gayle Dean Wardlow and Bruce Conforth, especially in their 2019 award-winning biography of Johnson: Up Jumped the Devil: The Real Life of Robert Johnson (Chicago Review Press). Two films, the 1991 documentary The Search for Robert Johnson by John Hammond Jr., and a 1997 documentary, ''Can't You Hear the Wind Howl, the Life and Music of Robert Johnson'', which included reconstructed scenes with Keb' Mo' as Johnson, were attempts to document his life, and demonstrated the difficulties arising from the scant historical record and conflicting oral accounts. Over the years, the significance of Johnson and his music has been recognized by numerous organizations and publications, including the Rock and Roll, Grammy, and Blues Halls of Fame; and the National Recording Preservation Board.","Hazlehurst, Mississippi, U.S.",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Johnson,Robert Leroy Johnson,"Greenwood, Mississippi",,

ZNKfI7j5Ba2ej8pRPlUuWm,John T. Redmond,38302225,"John Edward Redmond (1 September 1856 – 6 March 1918) was an Irish nationalist politician, barrister, and MP in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. He was best known as leader of the moderate Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) from 1900 until his death in 1918. He was also leader of the paramilitary organisation the Irish National Volunteers (INV). He was born to an old prominent Catholic family in rural Ireland; several relatives were politicians. He took over control of the minority IPP faction loyal to Charles Stewart Parnell when that leader died in 1891. Redmond was a conciliatory politician who achieved the two main objectives of his political life: party unity and, in September 1914, the passing of the Government of Ireland Act 1914. The Act granted limited self-government to Ireland, within the United Kingdom. However, implementation of Home Rule was suspended by the outbreak of the First World War. Redmond called on the National Volunteers to join Irish regiments of the New British Army and support the British and Allied war effort to restore the "" freedom of small nations "" on the European continent, thereby to also ensure the implementation of Home Rule after a war that was expected to be of short duration. However, after the Easter Rising of 1916, Irish public opinion shifted in favour of militant republicanism and full Irish independence, so that his party lost its dominance in Irish politics. Family influences and background John Edward Redmond (the younger) was born at Ballytrent House, Kilrane, County Wexford, his grandfather's old family mansion. He was the eldest son of William Archer Redmond, MP by Mary, daughter of General Hoey, the brother of Francis Hoey, heir of the Hoey seat, Dunganstown Castle, County Wicklow.","Kilrane, Ireland",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Redmond,,"London, England",,

He is also a co-owner of the NHL's Carolina Hurricanes.  Rein is known to often give assessments of the progress of his company and gives a monthly update in the magazine Game Developer where he provides a short update on the state of the Unreal Engine. He resides in Raleigh, North Carolina, though he was raised in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  Career Rein first got involved in the video game industry when he got in touch with John Romero, who at that time worked for id Software. Since Rein was a fan of the previous Commander Keen games, Romero got him to playtest the then under development Commander Keen 4. Rein was then brought in to handle the business side of id as its "" probationary president "" . He then negotiated a deal with FormGen to publish a retail Commander Keen game, Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter. This business relationship with id lasted until Spear of Destiny (which again, he negotiated as a retail version of Wolfenstein 3D). During the development of Wolfenstein 3D, he was later let go from id after a difference of opinion with the rest of the staff. He was also later joined at Epic by Jay Wilbur, id's ex-business manager, and Rein's involvement in id did mean that he was briefly mentioned in the book Masters of Doom.",,en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rein_(software_executive),< !-- only use if different from name -- >,,< !--  or  -- >,< !--  or  -- >

ZVntaxRVCaneJkZ0gLeu0J,Keith Rupert Murdoch,242365642,"Keith Rupert Murdoch  (  ; born 11 March 1931) is an Australian-born American billionaire businessman, media tycoon, and investor. Through his company News Corp, he is the owner of hundreds of local, national, and international publishing outlets around the world, including in the UK (The Sun and The Times), in Australia (The Daily Telegraph, Herald Sun and The Australian), in the US (The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post), book publisher HarperCollins, and the television broadcasting channels Sky News Australia and Fox News (through the Fox Corporation). He was also the owner of Sky (until 2018), 21st Century Fox (until 2019), and the now-defunct News of the World. After his father's death in 1952, Murdoch took over the running of The News, a small Adelaide newspaper owned by his father. In the 1950s and 1960s, Murdoch acquired a number of newspapers in Australia and New Zealand before expanding into the United Kingdom in 1969, taking over the News of the World, followed closely by The Sun. In 1974, Murdoch moved to New York City, to expand into the U.S. market; however, he retained interests in Australia and Britain. In 1981, Murdoch bought The Times, his first British broadsheet, and, in 1985, became a naturalized U.S. citizen, giving up his Australian citizenship, to satisfy the legal requirement for U.S. television network ownership.  In 1986, keen to adopt newer electronic publishing technologies, Murdoch consolidated his UK printing operations in London, causing bitter industrial disputes. His holding company News Corporation acquired Twentieth Century Fox (1985), HarperCollins (1989), and The Wall Street Journal (2007). Murdoch formed the British broadcaster BSkyB in 1990 and, during the 1990s, expanded into Asian networks and South American television.

Zb0vfDaeJHDbVsI5q5HdBZ,Elon R. Musk,39083403,"Elon Reeve Musk  (  ; born June 28, 1971) is an entrepreneur and business magnate. He is the founder, CEO, and Chief Engineer at SpaceX; early stage investor, CEO, and Product Architect of Tesla, Inc.; founder of The Boring Company; and co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI. A centibillionaire, Musk is one of the richest people in the world. Musk was born to a Canadian mother and South African father and raised in Pretoria, South Africa. He briefly attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada aged 17 to attend Queen's University. He transferred to the University of Pennsylvania two years later, where he received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but decided instead to pursue a business career, co-founding the web software company Zip2 with brother Kimbal. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. Musk co-founded online bank X.com that same year, which merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. The company was bought by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion. In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, of which he is CEO and CTO. In 2004, he joined electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.) as chairman and product architect, becoming its CEO in 2008. In 2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar energy services company that was later acquired by Tesla and became Tesla Energy. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company that promotes friendly artificial intelligence. In 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on developing brain–computer interfaces, and founded The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. Musk has proposed the Hyperloop, a high-speed vactrain transportation system. Musk has been the subject of criticism due to unorthodox or unscientific stances and highly publicized controversies. In 2018, he was sued for defamation by a diver who advised in the Tham Luang cave rescue; a California jury ruled in favor of Musk. In the same year, he was sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for falsely tweeting that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. He settled with the SEC, temporarily stepping down from his chairmanship and accepting limitations on his Twitter usage. Musk has spread misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic and has received criticism from experts for his other views on such matters as artificial intelligence and public transport.","Pretoria, South Africa",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk,Elon Reeve Musk,,,

Zn5quKBQu6zbGAUI7B3BgV,David Michael Solomon,24981813,"David Michael Solomon (born c. 1962) is an American investment banker, and the chief executive officer (CEO) of Goldman Sachs, a position he has held since October 2018. He has also been chairman of the bank since January 2019. Before assuming his role as CEO, Solomon was president and chief operating officer from January 2017 to September 2018, and was joint head of the investment banking division from July 2006 to December 2016. Solomon formally succeeded Lloyd Blankfein, the previous CEO, on October 1, 2018, and was named chairman after Blankfein's retirement.  Solomon also recreationally produces electronic dance music (EDM) records under the stage name "" David Solomon "" (previously known as DJ D-Sol ). He has performed at nightclubs and music festivals around New York, Miami, and The Bahamas.   He released his debut single, "" Don't Stop "" with an extended version on Spotify in June 2018. Early life David Michael Solomon was born circa 1962 in Hartsdale, New York. His father, Alan Solomon, was an executive vice president of a small publishing company, and his mother, Sandra, worked as an audiology supervisor. He grew up in Scarsdale, New York where he attended Edgemont Junior-Senior High School and worked at a local Baskin Robbins before working as a camp counselor in New Hampshire.   He graduated from Hamilton College in Clinton, New York, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science and government. In college he played on the rugby team and chaired his social fraternity, Alpha Delta Phi. After graduating, he applied to Goldman Sachs for a two-year analyst position but was rejected, leading him to apply to Irving Trust, a "" graduate school at [a] bank "" .  Career After Irving Trust, he went to work for Drexel Burnham in 1986. At Drexel Burnham he first worked as a commercial paper salesman, but later transitioned to junk bonds. His exposure to high-yield debt prompted him to join Bear Stearns. At Bear Stearns he was charged with leading the junk bonds division and selling higher-risk bonds. On one occasion, he assisted a struggling movie theater company in Dallas, Texas, to raise money through a "" complicated bond transaction "" .  Goldman Sachs He worked with a variety of Goldman Sachs managers during the late 1990s which inspired his move to the firm in 1999 to work with their leveraged finance team as a partner, aged 37. His move from Bear Stearns was "" shocking "" to contemporaries who believed him to be on the "" leadership track at Bear "" . Starting in 2006, he was promoted to and spent the next ten years leading Goldman's investment banking division. In July 2007, he secured the initial public offering (IPO) of LuLulemon Athletica wearing a maroon blazer and sweatpants, a sampling of the company's clothing to "" throw everyone off "" in a suit-required meeting. During his time as head, he implemented "" year-end compensation roundtables "" where he would pepper the executives with questions about their business practices in order to "" weed out under-performers "" . Upon his departure, he was credited with professionalizing the investment banking division and doubling profit margins from 11% to 22% with sales rising by 70%.  In April 2014, Sheldon Adelson, a client of his from Drexel Burnham, offered Solomon operational control over the Las Vegas Sands casinos. Solomon declined the offer because Adelson "" wasn’t willing to give up day-to-day control, and [he] didn’t want to be an understudy. "" Despite Goldman Sachs not disclosing his total compensation packages, SEC and IRS filings indicate that Solomon was paid a base salary of US$1.85 million with an award of restricted stock worth about $10 million in January 2015. After Gary Cohn resigned from Goldman to become the Chief Economic Advisor to Donald Trump, then President of the United States, Solomon was elevated to president and co-chief operating officer along with Harvey Schwartz in December 2016.   In a series of interviews in October 2017, Solomon detailed his advice for students and future employees at Goldman: know how to write and speak publicly, know accounting, and never lose sight of what you are passionate about. Under Solomon's leadership, the bank has increased pay for programmers, loosened dress codes, modernized computer systems, instituted video interviews, and created a "" real-time performance review "" system for new employees. Solomon received $11.85 million compensation package in January 2017 and January 2018.   It was estimated that Solomon holds 224,030 (0.059%) shares of Goldman Sachs Group (GS) which was valued at $58 million in January 2018. In March 2020, Solomon was granted some US$27.5 million in compensation. This was made up of his base pay which was a $2 million salary as well as a $7.65 million cash bonus. On top of that he also was granted $17.85 million in long-term incentive.","Hartsdale, New York, U.S.",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_M._Solomon,David Michael Solomon,,,

Graves Sr., attended Yale University and earned an MBA from Harvard University. While at Yale he was a member of Skull and Bones and captained the college basketball team. He currently is the all-time leading scorer in Yale men's basketball history and third all-time in Ivy League. He was drafted into the NBA by the Philadelphia 76ers and later played briefly for the Cleveland Cavaliers (1984–85). He was also drafted by the Dallas Cowboys. Graves has worked for Morgan Stanley, as president and CEO of Earl G. Graves Publishing Company, publisher of Black Enterprise magazine, and director of Autozone, Inc. In 1995, Graves was detained and searched by two New York Metro-North Police looking for a suspect who did not resemble Graves in any way except race. The police department publicly apologized and Metro-North Railroad purchased ads featuring a printed apology in three New York newspapers, including The New York Times.  On July 22, 2009, Graves stated to the media that "" there's nothing post-racial about U.S. "" , as he responded to the arrest of Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates. In February 2021, Graves said that the biggest challenge for African-American entrepreneurs is scale, and that 96 percent of Black-owned businesses are sole-proprietorships.

aJoFNEkxvyMfXLXmopRNtO,Chuanzhi Liu,410123,"Liu Chuanzhi ( ; born 29 April 1944) is a Chinese businessman and entrepreneur. Liu is the founder of Lenovo, the largest computer maker in the world. He remains one of the leaders of the company. Business activities Lenovo By the early 1980s, Liu had achieved relative success as a computer scientist but still felt frustrated with his career. While his work on magnetic data storage was important, it lacked direct practical applications. He said, "" We were the top computer technology research organization in China. We developed the first electron-tube computer and the first transistor computer. But we only produced one of each. Then we went on to develop something different. The work was just filed away. "" Liu was also anxious about his economic circumstances; in 1984, Liu had a growing family but an income of only 100RMB per month.  Liu founded Lenovo (originally called Legend), in 1984 with a group of ten other engineers in Beijing with 200,000 yuan and an office roughly 20 square yards in size. Liu came up with the idea to start Lenovo in response to a lack of funding at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). Liu's superior arranged for the academy to loan him and the other co-founders the afore-mentioned 200,000 yuan. Of this time, Liu said, "" It wasn't easy. The lowest thing you could do in the early '80s, as a scientist, was to go into business. China had a strict planned economy and there was barely room for a freewheeling company like ours. ""  Liu emphasized developing an effective working relationship with his superiors at the CAS from the very start. Despite its rhetoric of market-oriented reform, the Chinese government was reluctant to relax state control of the economy. Liu feared that his company might fail due to government micro-management. Liu also worried about dealing with local government officials and party cadres. He said, "" We were totally immersed in the environment of a planned economy. I didn't care that the investment was small, but I knew I must have control over finances, human resources and decision-making. "" Liu's superiors immediately granted his request for autonomy.","Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Chuanzhi,,,,

aTVLmnYhatadU4IDujdZzP,Sandeep Lakhmi Mathrani,655458017,"Sandeep Mathrani is an Indian-American real estate executive and the current chief executive of WeWork following the ouster of its former CEO, Adam Neumann. Prior to taking over WeWork, he was the CEO of GGP Inc and the retail group of its parent company Brookfield Property Partners. Early life and education Mathrani was born and raised in Gujarat, India. He went to high school at Cathedral and John Connon School in Mumbai, India. He emigrated to Philadelphia in the United States alone at the age of 16. In 1983, he graduated from college at the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey, obtaining his bachelor's degree in engineering and management science. In 1986, he obtained his master's degree in engineering from Stevens. According to Mathrani, he first got into real estate in 1986 by selling a used Nissan Sentra and using the proceeds to buy and flip an apartment building in Washington, D.C. for a $20,000 profit. In actual fact, he generated the funds in part by selling the Nissan and also by borrowing money using his credit card and securing a $52,000 loan from the US Federal Housing Administration (FHA). He was mentored by two real estate giants, Bruce Ratner and Steven Roth (of the Vornado real estate giant). Business career Mathrani began serving as the CEO of GGP Inc. in 2011 (just as the company was emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy). He was hired away from his previous job as an executive with Vornado Realty Trust, the company owned by his mentor. He served as CEO of GGP until 2018, when it was purchased by Brookfield Property. When the company was bought out, Mathrani netted roughly $189 million through the cash-and-stock takeover, which represented a combination of his golden parachute as CEO as well as the value of his shares. After the acquisition, Mathrani joined Brookfield as the chief executive of its retail property management arm.  In February 2020, Mathrani was brought on board as the new CEO of the struggling real estate company WeWork, following the ouster of its CEO Adam Neumann and the collapse of its IPO.","Gujarat, India",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandeep_Mathrani,,,,

actrSzTWirwaz11ANaA1eY,Pedro J. Pizarro,54129357,"Pedro Pizarro (c. 1515 & nbsp;– c. 1602) was a Spanish chronicler and conquistador. He took part in most events of the Spanish conquest of Peru and wrote an extensive chronicle of them under the title Relación del descubrimiento y conquista de los reinos del Perú ( "" Relation of the discovery and conquest of the kingdoms of Peru "" ), which he finished in 1571. Biography Pedro Pizarro was born around 1515 in the Spanish city of Toledo. Through his father he was first cousin of Francisco Pizarro and his half-brothers: Gonzalo Pizarro, Hernando Pizarro and Juan Pizarro.  Means, Introduction, p. 79. When Francisco left Spain for his third expedition to Peru he was joined by his brothers and his cousin Pedro. They sailed from Sanlúcar de Barrameda in February 1530 and arrived at Tumbes in what is now Peru in January 1531.  Means, Chronology, p. 122. Pedro initially served as page to his cousin Francisco but from about 1533 he was in active military service as a cavalryman.  Means, Introduction, pp. 79, 97–98. As such he took part in most of the chief events of the conquest of the Inca empire, mainly during the campaigns against Manco Inca.  Means, Introduction, p. 79–80.  Pedro Pizarro fought at the Battle of Las Salinas (April 26, 1538) against Diego de Almagro, rival and former partner of Francisco Pizarro. He then took part in the foundation of the city of Arequipa (August 15, 1540) where he established himself. The almagristas revolted again in 1541, murdering Francisco Pizarro, so Pedro Pizarro fought them at the Battle of Chupas (September 16, 1542) under the command of Cristóbal Vaca de Castro.  Means, Introduction, p. 80. When Gonzalo Pizarro revolted against the Spanish Crown, Pedro Pizarro refused his requests to join his rebellion. However, his loyalty was put in doubt for a letter he wrote to his cousin on December 18, 1546, which shows some vacillations in his loyalty probably prompted by material considerations. This letter fell into the hands of Pedro de la Gasca, an envoy sent by the Crown to pacify the country. La Gasca used the letter as an excuse to deny Pedro Pizarro the rewards he claimed after the Battle of Xaquixaguana (April 9, 1548) where Gonzalo Pizarro was defeated.  Means, Introduction, pp. 80–81.  Despite this rebuff, Pedro Pizarro could be considered a rich and well-rewarded man. On November 28, 1538, he had received from Francisco Pizarro lands and native workers in Arequipa, Tacna and other regions; he received further grants from time to time by various authorities.  Means, Introduction, p. 81. When he was very young, he fathered a natural daughter, Isabel Pizarro; he later had numerous legitimate children. Pedro Pizarro married twice: his first wife was María Cornejo, but nothing is known about his second wife.  Means, Introduction, pp. 81–82. The death date of Pedro Pizarro is not known. It happened after 1571 when he finished writing his chronicle and could have taken place as late as 1602 when viceroy Luis de Velasco, marqués de Salinas made a grant to a Pedro Pizarro, however, this Pedro may have been a son of the chronicler.  Means, Introduction, pp. 82–83.",Toledo,en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Pizarro,,Arequipa,c. 1515,c. 1602

She was an alternate member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of China, one of the few women to have entered China's top decision-making body. Early life Chen Muhua was born in 1921 in Qingtian County, Zhejiang Province, during the Republic of China period. Her uncle was a Kuomintang air force official who helped her complete high school education, but she was sympathetic to the Communist cause and went to Yan'an, the wartime base of the Communists, in 1938, after the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War. She told her mother that she would return in six months, but was unable to go home until the end of the war in 1945, when her mother had already died.  Chen studied military science at the Counter-Japanese Military and Political University in Yan'an, and joined the Communist Party of China. Her teachers included Zhu De, Chen Yun, and Otto Braun (known in China as "" Li De "" ). During the Yan'an Rectification Movement, she was subject to constant investigation because of her Kuomintang uncle, despite being pregnant. She was forced to give away her daughter when she was born in 1943. The investigation ended only with the intervention of Zhou Enlai. During the Chinese Civil War, she worked a number of jobs in the Rehe Military Region.  People's Republic of China After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Chen worked in economic areas, serving as head of the Railway and Long-term Planning offices of the State Planning Commission's Transport Bureau in the 1950s. In the 1960s, she worked in the Foreign Economic Relations General Liaison Office, where she was in charge of China's foreign aid to African countries.  During the Cultural Revolution, Chen was labeled a "" capitalist roader "" , partly because she had suggested that cadres dealing with foreign countries should learn foreign languages. There was also rumour that Chen Cheng, the Kuomintang Vice-President of the Republic of China on Taiwan, was her uncle. Chen Muhua's brother was persecuted to death in Heilongjiang Province.","Qingtian County, Zhejiang, China",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Muhua,,"Beijing, China",1921,12 May 2011 (aged 90)

His retirement timetable moved forward from end-2008, when Browne would be 60, when BP policy called for mandatory retirement, to July 2007. Hayward, having been described as CEO designate by both internal and media commentators, came to the fore amid the competition, including Robert Dudley, chief executive of TNK-BP, the company's Russian joint venture, and John Manzoni, head of refining and marketing.","Slough, Buckinghamshire, England",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hayward,,,,

Herman was the first African-American to hold the position. Prior to serving as Secretary, she was Assistant to the President and Director of the White House Office of Public Engagement. Herman grew up in Mobile, Alabama. After college, she worked to improve employment opportunities for black laborers and women. She then joined the administration of Jimmy Carter, working as director of the Labor Department's Women's Bureau. She became active in the Democratic party, working in the campaigns of Jesse Jackson and then serving as chief of staff for the Democratic National Committee under Ronald H. Brown.

Her father became Alabama's first black ward leader. She later recounted how members of the white supremacist group, the Ku Klux Klan, assaulted her father when she was five years old.   When Herman was growing up in Mobile, schools remained racially segregated. Her parents opted to send Alexis to parochial school, in part because the teachers included white nuns and priests, and thus would expose her to greater diversity.  Herman attended the Heart of Mary High School.  -- > As a sophomore, she was suspended for questioning the diocese's exclusion of black students from religious pageants in which white students participated. Following a week of objection from the parents of Herman's fellow black classmates, she was re-admitted.","Mobile, Alabama, U.S.",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Herman,Alexis Margaret Herman,,,

He is notable for providing performance-enhancing drugs to Major League Baseball players, and also for testifying against former New York Yankees pitcher Roger Clemens at a 2008 United States Congressional hearing that concerned the veracity of the 2007 George J. Mitchell Report. McNamee, the youngest of eight children born to John Francis McNamee (1925-2020) and Eleanor Margaret Harte (1931-2018),  grew up in Breezy Point, Queens. He attended Archbishop Molloy High School. From 1986 to 1989, McNamee was a student at St. John's University in Queens.  Kovaleski, Serge F.

"" Mr. McNamee was raised in the Breezy Point section of Queens, on the westward end of the Rockaway Peninsula, an area with many police officers, like his father. As a youngster Mr. McNamee was drawn to baseball and became a catcher playing at Archbishop Molloy High School in Queens (in which he was the M.V.P. of the league & captain of the team and then at St. John’s University (also captain of the team) which he attended from 1986 through 1989, majoring in athletic administration, McNamee received a Masters(MS) in Sports Medicine from Long Island University (L.I.U.), according to a spokesman for St. Johns University( S.J.U.), Dominic Sianna. "" At one point he was employed at St John's University, teaching in the sports management program.  ESPN – McNamee takes center stage with bombshells about Clemens – MLB  McNamee falsely held himself out to be a doctor.   He claimed his doctorate was from Columbus University (Louisiana).  The Mitchell Report McNamee gained notoriety following the release of Major League Baseball's Mitchell Report, which alleges that McNamee helped acquire performance-enhancing drugs including anabolic steroids, amphetamines, and human growth hormone (HGH) for some or all of the players he personally trained, who included Roger Clemens, Andy Pettitte, and Chuck Knoblauch. McNamee told the Mitchell Commission during their 20-month investigation that he began injecting Clemens with steroids during the 1998 season and that he continued to provide these steroids through 2001. Given the dominant performances produced by Clemens from that time forward, such that Clemens had become widely expected to be a future member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame, many feel that this claim constitutes the most incendiary accusation in the Mitchell Report.  On January 4, 2008, Clemens had a telephone conversation with McNamee in which Clemens stated he "" just wants the truth "" from someone, never actually telling his former personal trainer to come out and clear the pitcher's name.  Clemens said many times in the conversation that the steroid accusations were false; McNamee never agreed or disagreed when this statement was made, simply pleading, "" ...tell me what you want me to do. "" McNamee did state, however, "" It is what it is, "" meaning he told the truth. Clemens filed a lawsuit against McNamee shortly before the recorded conversation for defamation of character.  McNamee's attorneys argued that McNamee was compelled to cooperate by federal officials and thus his statements were protected. A federal judge agreed, throwing out all claims related to McNamee's statements to investigators on February 13, 2009 but allowing the case to proceed on statements McNamee made about Clemens to Andy Pettitte.

Johnson (born October 9, 1960) is an American businessman and software engineer who has been the president and chief executive officer (CEO) of Starbucks Coffee Company since 2017. Succeeding Howard Schultz as CEO, Johnson previously served as the company's president and chief operating officer from 2015 to 2017. Born in Gig Harbor, Washington, Johnson was raised in Los Alamos, New Mexico. He graduated from New Mexico State University in 1981 before embarking on a career in software development. Johnson first worked at a systems engineer at IBM during the late-1980s, before moving to Microsoft in 1992 to working in global technical support.

Working closely with Microsoft CEO Steve Balmer and founder Bill Gates, Johnson oversaw strategy for Microsoft and the firm's online search and advertising strategy. Johnson left Microsoft during the 2007-08 financial crisis to serve as chief executive of Juniper Networks from September 2008 to January 2014. Johnson first joined Starbucks in September 2009 as a board member after which Schultz asked him to take a greater role at the firm. He was subsequently appointed chief operating officer for two years before becoming chief executive. Under his tenure, Starbucks has streamlined its core business, managed corporate programs to address racial inequality in the U.S., and revamped its product suite horizontally, particularly in espresso machine manufacturing and technological innovation. Outside of his professional career, Johnson served under U.S. presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama on the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC), a national cybersecurity task force.

He is executive chairman and former CEO of American International Group. Duperreault's entire career has been in the insurance industry, beginning in 1973 as an actuary at AIG. He quickly rose through the ranks to become one of AIG's most senior executives, eventually heading all of AIG's international operations. He was regarded as a likely successor to CEO Hank Greenberg, but as Greenberg showed no signs of retiring Duperreault left AIG in 1994 to head ACE Limited, a boutique specialty-insurance company based in Bermuda. During his 10 years as Chairman and CEO of ACE Limited, Duperreault transformed it into global multi-line insurance and reinsurance powerhouse. This also helped to transform Bermuda from an island nation with a small, reinsurance-focused market into a global insurance center. After retiring in 2006, upon request Duperreault came out of retirement in January 2008 to turn around the ailing Marsh & McLennan Companies, which was still suffering after a 2004 bid-rigging scandal that cost the company both hundreds of millions of dollars and also its reputation and morale.

"" James Dolan "" . Wall Street Journal. As the companies' chairman, Dolan oversees all operations within the company and also supervises day-to-day operations of its professional sports teams, the New York Knicks and New York Rangers as well as their regional sports networks, which include MSG Network and MSG Plus. Dolan previously served as CEO of Cablevision until its sale in June 2016. Early life Dolan is the son of Cablevision founder Charles Dolan and his wife, Helen Ann Dolan. He is of Irish descent. After originally pursuing a career in music, Dolan eventually switched to a major in communications at SUNY New Paltz and began working for Cablevision in various capacities including sales before eventually being dispatched to Cleveland by his father to manage the launching of a sports radio station. In 1995, he was made CEO of Cablevision. Throughout his early adult life, Dolan battled drug and alcohol problems and was reportedly known for having a volatile temper. In 1993, he went to drug rehabilitation at the Hazelden clinic in Center City, Minnesota.  Business management Dolan opposed his father's proposed Voom satellite service, which became a polarizing controversy among Cablevision's Board of Directors. While supporters argued Voom could propel Cablevision into the future emerging satellite market and a wider customer base, opponents of the plan, including James Dolan, argued it was too expensive with no expense relief for the foreseeable future. In the end, the younger Dolan prevailed and Voom was shut down. This was an instrumental event in Dolan emerging from his father's shadow, albeit reluctantly, as a viable businessman.  His business career has included multiple failures, which include purchasing the failing Wiz electronics and entertainment chain, which ended up posting losses of $250 million before being liquidated, and the Clearview Cinemas chain which has failed to generate any significant revenue.","Massapequa, New York, US",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_L._Dolan,James Lawrence Dolan,,,< !--  (death date then birth date) -- >

He was assistant manager to Neil Shipperley at North Greenford United before the pair left after the 2011–12 season. He then returned with Shipperley to North Greenford United in October 2012 after Jon-Barrie Bates left by mutual consent.  He also played in the Football League for Reading, Grimsby Town, Colchester United and Torquay United, as well as playing in the Scottish Football League for Partick Thistle, Hamilton Academical and Clydebank. Playing career Chelsea Nicholls was born in Hillingdon, London. A forward, he began his career as a trainee with Chelsea, turning professional in August 1995. He made his league debut in the 1996–97 season, after gaining experience on loan with non-league Chertsey Town, but made a real breakthrough into the Chelsea side the following season, appearing in 18 Premier League games in 1997–98. That season he also scored three league goals; one after coming on as a substitute as Chelsea won 6–1 at rivals Tottenham Hotspur in December 1997, and two more, again after coming on as a substitute, against Coventry City the following month. That season Chelsea also won the 1997–98 League Cup and the 1997–98 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. Nicholls wasn't part of the squad for either final but contributed two appearances to each of the cup runs. At the start of the League Cup run Chelsea needed a penalty shoot-out to beat Blackburn Rovers, and Nicholls scored the winning penalty to send Chelsea through.  However, as the number of foreign imports grew at Stamford Bridge, he fell further out of the reckoning and joined Reading on loan in December 1999 with a view to a permanent move. Despite scoring three goals including one on his debut, the move fell through and on 10 February he returned to a peripheral role at Stamford Bridge. He joined Grimsby Town on loan on 24 February 2000, and then Colchester United on loan on 6 October the following season. He had an unsuccessful trial with Motherwell in March 2001 and was released by Chelsea at the end of the season, having scored three times in 36 league games, although 25 of those appearances were as a substitute.","Hillingdon, England",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Nicholls,,,,

Along with Eric Bristow and Jocky Wilson, he was known for dominating darts during the 1980s. Lowe was world champion on three occasions, in 1979, 1987 and 1993. He was also a two-time winner of the Winmau World Masters and a two-time World Cup singles champion. In total, Lowe won 15 BDO and WDF majors. He held the World No. 1 ranking on four occasions. In October 1984, he became the first player to hit a televised nine-dart finish. Lowe is one of only six players to have won the World Championship three or more times, and was the first person to win it in three separate decades; along with Phil Taylor, he remains one of only two players to achieve this. Amidst growing dissatisfaction with the British Darts Organisation, Lowe was also one of 16 players who in 1993 broke away to form their own governing body, the World Darts Council (now known as the Professional Darts Corporation). Career Lowe won the World Championship title in three different decades – 1979, 1987 and 1993. He met Eric Bristow six times in the World Championship in various semi-finals and finals, and it was not until his fourth attempt (in the 1987 final) that he managed to overcome his rival. His record against Bristow in majors was three wins and six defeats.  Lowe achieved the first ever televised nine-dart finish (the sport's equivalent of a 147 break in snooker) on 13 October 1984 during the World Matchplay tournament against Keith Deller, although it was not live and instead shown on a highlights programme on ITV. Lowe won £102,000 for this success. He went on to win the tournament.",England,en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lowe,,,,

cfyiCZOzkQ7akZi7fPDcot,Kenzo Tsujimoto,8836063,"(born December 15, 1940) is a Japanese businessman who founded the video game companies Irem and Capcom. He has also served as president of Computer Software Copyright Association (ACCS) since 1997, and was president of Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association from 2002 to 2006. Biography Tsujimoto was born in Kashihara, Nara, as the third son of a blacksmith. In 1956, after graduating from junior high school from his father's early death, he got a job at a nearby company, and at the same time entered the part-time system of Nara Prefectural Unebi Senior High School. After graduating from the school in March 1960, he got a job at an uncle's food wholesale company. In March 1963, he was transferred to the confectionery wholesale business run by his uncle and became independent, and although the company name was changed to Tsujimoto Shoten, he failed to manage and had a debt of several million yen.  「トップの肖像 辻本憲三」『Toyo Keizai』2011年7月9日号、pp.98-103  In 1968, the confectionery retailer Tsujimoto Shoten was reopened in Osaka, and when the children lined up at the cotton candy making machine placed in the candy corner, it was not for the product itself, but for the process of making cotton candy. Two years later, Tsujimoto was peddling all over the country for the performance of selling this cotton candy making machine, and on his way home, he was entrusted with the modification of the pachinko machine and sold 1,000 units per model, so he was convinced that game entertainment would grow in the future. 「ワイドインタビュー 問答有用380 辻本憲三」『エコノミスト』2011年12月27日号、pp.50-53 『日経スペシャル カンブリア宮殿』2010年8月2日放送  In July 1974, Tsujimoto founded IPM, which became Irem and became its president. He established I.R.M. Corporation on May 30, 1979, and IRM changed its name to Sambi in 1981. The company released "" IPM Invaders "" and "" Capsule Invaders "" under license from Taito during the Invaders game epidemic. However, at Irem, Tsujimoto who was the chairman, was forced out because of poor performance due to the retreat of the Invaders boom. 赤木真澄『それは「ポン」から始まった アーケードTVゲームの成り立ち』アミューズメント通信社、2005年、p.339 朝日新聞2016年8月12日夕刊3面「人生の贈り物-私の半生-」より。  On June 11, 1983, he founded Capcom as a sales company for Sambi and became president and representative director. In July of the same year, the company's first game Little League was released. In 1989, Sambi, which was developed, absorbed and merged with Capcom, which was in charge of sales, and changed the name of the surviving company, Sambi, to Capcom, and Tsujimoto continued to serve as president.","Kashihara, Nara, Japan",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenzo_Tsujimoto,,,,

Early friendship with Sir John Barrow, keeper of the admiralty records, brought Pearce a commission to paint "" The Arctic Council discussing a plan of search for Sir John Franklin "" . This work was completed in 1851 and depicted several noted explorers of the Royal Navy, all experienced in sailing Arctic waters, including Back. It was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1853, and was engraved by James Scott. Pearce's painting increased the public interest in Franklin's fate. Pearce also painted for Barrow half-length portraits of Sir Robert McClure, Sir Leopold McClintock, Sir George Nares, and Captain Penny in their Arctic dress, and a series of small portraits of other arctic explorers. Lady Jane Franklin commissioned a similar series, which passed at her death to Sophia Cracroft, her husband's niece. All these pictures are in the National Portrait Gallery, to which Barrow and Cracroft respectively bequeathed them. Pearce's other sitters included Barrow himself (for the Royal Society), Sir Francis Beaufort, Sir James Clark Ross (for Greenwich Hospital), Sir Edward Sabine, Sir George Gabriel Stokes, Charles Lever, Sims Reeves, Sir Erasmus Wilson (Hospital for Diseases of the Skin, Westgate-on-Sea, copied for the Royal College of Surgeons), and the seventh Duke of Bedford.","King's Mews, London, England",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Pearce,,"Paddington, London, England",,

He scored all his aerial victories while flying a Nakajima Ki-27. Early life Hiromichi Shinohara was born in August 1913 on a farm in Suzumenomiya, near Utsunomiya in the Tochigi Prefecture. After finishing his formal education he went into military service, joining the 27th Cavalry Regiment in 1931. In that capacity he took part in the Japanese invasion of Manchuria and was involved in the Jiangqiao Campaign in April 1932.

dWv8ky9GB6MbrlueFQHW3U,Chih-Ling Chen,22166731,"Linda Chen ( ; also known as Linda Chen Mock Hock or Linda Chen Mong Hock; 1928 & ndash; 29 December 2002) was a Chinese-born, Singaporean linguist, writer, feminist and businesswoman. Having immigrated from China as a young child, Chen learned Chinese, English, and Malay and used her linguistic talent to write a Malay-Chinese dictionary that became widely used to teach Malay in the 1950s and 1960s. During her student days, she became active in the anti-colonial and women's rights movement. Because of her activism and heritage, she was seen as a threat and a ring-leader of communist infiltration into the country. Despite her denials that she was not a communist, she was arrested in 1956 and jailed for 20 months, detained and kept under surveillance for four years between 1959 and 1963, and rearrested in 1963 as part of Operation Coldstore. After her release from prison, she lived in London for four years and then returned to Singapore, where she managed her family's multi-national book store until her death. Biography Linda Chen was born in 1928 in Wenzhou, Chekiang Province, Republic of China and came as a child to Singapore with her parents. Her father, Chen Yoh Shoo, was a wealthy businessman in Singapore. She attended Chung Hwa Girls' School and then in 1951, she began studying history at the University of Malaya in Singapore. She joined the University Socialist Club shortly after starting college. Becoming a leader in student politics, she was one of the founders of the Pan-Malayan Students’ Federation (PMSF) After finishing her undergraduate degree, with a thesis on the Muslim scholar , she worked briefly as an English teacher at Chung Cheng High School and then began work on her master's degree. She compiled a Malay-Chinese dictionary during this period and translated several Chinese children's stories into Malay.  Because she spoke English and Chinese, Chen was able to bridge the language divide for student groups and facilitate them working together. She also worked as an editor on the PMSF newsletter The Malayan Student Chinese edition. Her influence cause her to be placed under surveillance by the British authorities who feared communist expansion and saw the student activists creation of left-wing, united fronts as fertile ground for the spread of communism. She became president of the Singapore Anti-Yellow Cultural Council (SAYCC), which the students classified as an organized effort to rid society of hedonistic Western influence and did not necessarily consider themselves to be communists. The government saw the student movement as a threat to the existing government and a communist front. In 1956, Chen founded the Singapore Women's Federation (SWF) as a group to press for women's rights and simultaneously fight against colonialism and a social order which favored the English. She and other radicals believed women's struggle for equality was linked to social change and class struggle. The organization was shut down immediately  and Chen was arrested, accused of being a security threat. The government issued a statement that she was to be deported to China, but some legislators argued that since she had lived in Singapore since she was five, she was not an alien. Both Chen and her parents plead for her to be sent to Britain to finish her studies. She spent 20 months in prison before her release in 1958. That same year she married Tan Seng Huat, who she had met during her student days. She became a lecturer in the History of Southeast Asia at Nanyang University and completed her masters with a thesis on Early Chinese Newspapers in Singapore: 1881-1912. She returned to women's rights issues and participated in the debates and planning for the Women's Charter to revise the marriage laws of Singapore.","Wenzhou, Chekiang Province, Republic of China",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Chen,Chen Mong Hock,Singapore,"< !--  for living people.

Diesel Emissions Scandal As the current CEO of Volkswagen Group, Herbert Diess was prosecuted, along with and Hans Dieter Pötsch, the chairman of the supervisory board of Volkswagen, on September 24, 2019, for the manipulation of Volkswagen's diesel emissions. Shareholders were withheld from being informed about the huge financial implications due to the falsified diesel emissions. The scandal then gained media attention which highlights German law. German law requires top executives to inform shareholders about significant financial risks and issues. This follows after the investigation of finding that Volkswagen's rigged millions of diesel cars worldwide to cheat on emissions tests which led the company to lose over $30 billion. As a result the spurious information, the stocks plummeted almost 40 per cent. However Volkswagen defended themselves: "" The company has meticulously investigated this matter with the help of internal and external legal experts for almost four years ... the result is clear: the allegations are groundless.

Under her leadership in 2019, the company was scheduled to close dozens of stores after shifting its focus to home goods and women's clothes. Some criticized the slow approach pointing out that the slow approach might have been as dangerous as the previous CEO's quick approach She had also brought in new talent and has cleaned out inventory.

Rohr served as CEO from May 2000 to April 2013 and as Chairman from May 2001 to April 2014, both times taking over for Tom O'Brien. He is currently chairman of the Carnegie Mellon University Board of Trustees. Early life Rohr was the grandson of an Alsatian (then Germany) immigrant to America, a cook in a hotel, who married the hotel's Irish laundress and opened his own restaurant in Cleveland, Ohio. "" Pittsburgher of the Year: Jim Rohr "" Rohr's father, also a Cleveland restaurateur died when Rohr was still in grade school. Rohr graduated from Cleveland's Saint Ignatius High School and from the University of Notre Dame in 1970 with a B.A.. Two years later, in 1972, Rohr earned an MBA degree from Ohio State University. Rohr's wife, Sharon, is from Chagrin Falls. Professional life Prior to becoming Chairman & CEO of PNC, Rohr had spent his entire 28-year professional life at PNC-affiliated or predecessor companies. As CEO, Rohr managed a major accounting scandal that plagued PNC soon after he assumed leadership of the banking firm. By shifting $762 million in underperforming assets and loans to accounts that were kept off the corporation's balance sheet, PNC was forced to restate its 2001 earnings.  The first few years in an executive role at PNC were turbulent for Rohr. PNC's stock price lost roughly half of its overall value throughout 2001 and at shareholders' meetings during that time, shareholders began to demand that Rohr resign from his position.

fViSoaVc8Lmc1hQWsQhcwh,Lawrence J. Ellison,87412,"Lawrence Joseph Ellison (born August 17, 1944) is an American business magnate and investor who is a co-founder, the executive chairman and chief technology officer (CTO) of Oracle Corporation. As of April 2021, he was listed by Bloomberg Billionaires Index as the ninth-wealthiest person in the United States and as the tenth-wealthiest in the world, with a fortune of $93.9 & nbsp;billion, increased from $57.3 & nbsp;billion in 2018. He is also the owner of the 41st largest island in the United States, Lanai in the Hawaiian Islands with a population of just over 3000.  Early life and education Larry Ellison was born in New York City, to an unwed Jewish mother.    His biological father was an Italian-American United States Army Air Corps pilot. After Ellison contracted pneumonia at the age of nine months, his mother gave him to her aunt and uncle for adoption. He did not meet his biological mother again until he was 48.  Ellison moved to Chicago's South Shore, then a middle-class neighborhood. He remembers his adoptive mother as warm and loving, in contrast to his austere, unsupportive, and often distant adoptive father, who had chosen the name Ellison to honor his point of entry into the United States, Ellis Island. Louis Ellison was a government employee who had made a small fortune in Chicago real estate, only to lose it during the Great Depression.  Although Ellison was raised in a Reform Jewish home by his adoptive parents, who attended synagogue regularly, he remained a religious skeptic. Ellison states: "" While I think I am religious in one sense, the particular dogmas of Judaism are not dogmas I subscribe to. I don't believe that they are real. They're interesting stories. They're interesting mythology, and I certainly respect people who believe these are literally true, but I don't. I see no evidence for this stuff. "" At age thirteen, Ellison refused to have a bar mitzvah celebration.

Ellison says that his fondness for Israel is not connected to religious sentiments, but rather due to the innovative spirit of Israelis in the technology sector.","New York City, U.S.",en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Ellison,Lawrence Joseph Ellison,,,

fYLSKAs6mgQbVleB2asAL5,Mark Stephan Sutton,40114748,"Mark Sutton (13 April 1971 – 14 August 2013) (subscription required). was a British stuntman who took part in the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony by parachuting from a helicopter above the stadium as James Bond. He died in a wingsuit flying accident near Les Grandes Otanes in Switzerland. He had been travelling at around 125mph when he hit a ridge. Life Mark Sutton was the son of Air Marshal Sir John Matthias Dobson Sutton KCB, former Lieutenant-Governor of the Island of Jersey, and Lady Angela Sutton. He was educated at Royal Military Academy Sandhurst where he won the Sword of Honour. He received an officer's commission in the 6th Queen Elizabeth's Own Gurkha Rifles in December 1991, and served as an Army Officer until 1995. Upon leaving the Army, he changed career and moved into finance in the city of London. When he died, Sutton was working as a consultant for The Royal Bank of Scotland.  London 2012 Olympics During a segment of the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics entitled "" Happy and Glorious "" , Sutton served as a stunt double of James Bond on a helicopter in a filmed portion of the segment. Alongside his friend Gary Connery (who was The Queen's double for the segment), Sutton skydived out of the helicopter into the Olympic Stadium. Following the ceremony, the sequence was described as one of its highlights by the media.  Death In August 2013, Mark Sutton and 20 other top wingsuiters were invited to a three-day event in Chamonix, France known as Helibase 74, which was organised by Epic TV, a web TV channel specialising in extreme sports. In exchange for video footage of their flights, the website provided accommodations and helicopter access. On 14 August 2013, Sutton jumped alongside Tony Uragallo (both equipped with multiple video cameras) in a short "" warm-up "" flight near Les Grandes Otanes scheduled to last about a minute. However, tragedy struck only 20 seconds into the flight; as he jumped from the helicopter at , travelling at speeds of up to , Sutton veered off-course and crashed into a mountain ridge. A rescue helicopter arrived soon after Sutton hit the ground, but he was pronounced dead at the scene—Sutton's impact was so severe that a DNA test was required to identify his body, and a spokesperson stated that he had no chance of surviving the impact. While Sutton was equipped with a parachute during the flight for landing, it was left unused. As part of the investigation, the video footage from Uragallo's cameras were handed over to a Swiss police unit.  An Epic TV spokesperson considered Sutton's death to be an accident, noting that two successful flights with other wingsuiters were held prior, and that they had planned to be "" conservative "" that day due to the large number of flights planned. The remaining participants in the event elected to continue on in honour of Sutton.",United Kingdom,en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Sutton,,"Mont Blanc < ref name= "" Death Telegraph "" / >",,"< ref name= "" Death Telegraph "" >  < /ref >"

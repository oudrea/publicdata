One of the reasons for this, is that Coca-Cola and Nestlé want to pursue different strategies in a rapidly changing market. Nestlé will handle the distribution of Nestea in most countries except in Canada, Spain, Portugal, Romania, Andorra, Bulgaria, Hungary and Serbia where Coca-Cola will retain a license. In 2019, Nestea rebranded as a natural product.

Originally marketed as a temperance drink and intended as a patent medicine, it was invented in the late 19th century by John Stith Pemberton and was bought out by businessman Asa Griggs Candler, whose marketing tactics led Coca-Cola to its dominance of the world soft-drink market throughout the 20th century. The drink's name refers to two of its original ingredients: coca leaves, and kola nuts (a source of caffeine). The current formula of Coca-Cola remains a trade secret; however, a variety of reported recipes and experimental recreations have been published. The drink has inspired imitators and created a whole classification of soft drink: colas. The Coca-Cola Company produces concentrate, which is then sold to licensed Coca-Cola bottlers throughout the world. The bottlers, who hold exclusive territory contracts with the company, produce the finished product in cans and bottles from the concentrate, in combination with filtered water and sweeteners. A typical 12-US-fluid-ounce (350 ml) can contains 38 grams (1.3 oz) of sugar (usually in the form of high-fructose corn syrup). The bottlers then sell, distribute, and merchandise Coca-Cola to retail stores, restaurants, and vending machines throughout the world. The Coca-Cola Company also sells concentrate for soda fountains of major restaurants and foodservice distributors. The Coca-Cola Company has on occasion introduced other cola drinks under the Coke name. The most common of these is Diet Coke, along with others including Caffeine-Free Coca-Cola, Diet Coke Caffeine-Free, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Coca-Cola Cherry, Coca-Cola Vanilla, and special versions with lemon, lime, and coffee. Coca-Cola was called Coca-Cola Classic from July 1985 to 2009, to distinguish it from ""New Coke"". Based on Interbrand's ""best global brand"" study of 2020, Coca-Cola was the world's sixth most valuable brand. In 2013, Coke products were sold in over 200 countries worldwide, with consumers drinking more than 1.8 billion company beverage servings each day. Coca-Cola ranked No. 87 in the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.","[""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Coca-Cola_logo.svg?width=300"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Coca-Cola_logo.svg"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Coca-Cola_2021.svg""]","[""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Coca-cola_(2).jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Coca-Cola_logo.svg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Coca_Cola_ad_ca._1943_IMG_3744.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Coca_Cola_Bottling_Machine,_Biedenharn_Museum_and_Gardens_IMG_4101.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/ContourBottleConceptSketch.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Alexander_Samuelson.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/6_Coca-Cola_bottles.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Weihnachtstruck.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/1BILLIONTHgallonCOCACOLAowner.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Camion_cocacola_argentina_1942.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/VWT2_Coca_Cola.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/NASA_FGBA.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/19th_century_Coca-Cola_coupon.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Coke_Museum.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Ft_Dodge_ghost_sign.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Commercial._At_the_Coca_Cola_Plant_BAnQ_P48S1P06539.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/World-of-coca-cola.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Flasche_Coca-Cola_0,2_Liter.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/1915_contour_Coca-Cola_contour_bottle_prototype.png"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/FLEEMANSpharmacyCOKErwLIPACKowner.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Madonna&apos;s_Coca-Coca_bottle_(7961835112).jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Cabo_Verde_Fogo_CokeBooth.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/John_Pemberton.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Pembertoncokeanzeige.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Cocacola-5cents-1900_edit1.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Coca-Cola_1915_Contour_bottle.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Coca-Cola_2.5L_bottle_in_Mainland_China_20160514.jpg"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:15-09-26-RalfR-WLC-0098.jpg""]"

It is located in the southeast of the department of La Guajira, close to the border with Venezuela. The coal mine is situated in the northeastern part of the Cesar-Ranchería Basin, the basin of the Ranchería River, between the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in the west and the Serranía del Perijá to the southeast. At Cerrejón, low-ash, low-sulphur bituminous coal from the Cerrejón Formation is excavated. The mine is one of the largest of its type, the largest in Latin America and the tenth biggest in the world. Cerrejón extends over 690 square kilometres (270 sq mi). It is divided into three sections, North Zone, Central Zone and South Zone. Total proven reserves are estimated at 503 megatonnes. In 2016, the mine produced 32,683,315 tonnes (32,167,132 long tons; 36,027,188 short tons). In June 2020, lawyers for the local Wayuu community lodged a request to the United Nations special rapporteur for human rights and the environment for work to be immediately halted over environmental and human rights concerns. In September 2020, several UN independent human rights experts called for the mining operations to be halted, citing the serious damage to the environment and the negative effects on the health and other rights of the indigenous peoples who live in the area. These experts include the Special Rapporteur for human rights and the environment, the Special Rapporteur on the right to food, the Special Rapporteur on the right to health, the Special Rapporteur on the rights to water and sanitation, the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, the Special Rapporteur on hazardous substances and wastes, the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, and the Working Group on human rights and transnational corporations.","[""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Cerrejón_3.jpg?width=300""]","[""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Tren_de_carga_Cerrejón.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Puerto_Bolívar,_Guajira,_Colombia.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Cerrejón_3.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Cerrejonmine1.png"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Cerrejonmine3.png"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cerrejón_mine.JPG"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cerrejón_3.jpg""]"

Sunbeam had always made ambulances on modified Sunbeam car chassis. S T D Motors chose to enter the large commercial vehicle market in the late 1920s, and once established they made petrol and diesel buses and electrically powered trolleybuses and milk floats. Commercial Vehicles became a separate department of Sunbeam in 1931. Ownership switched from S T D Motors to Rootes Securities in mid-1935, and later that year their Karrier trolleybus designs were added to Sunbeam production lines. In 1946 J. Brockhouse and Co of West Bromwich bought Sunbeam but in September 1948 sold the trolleybus part of the business to Guy Motors. In the early 1950s the amalgamated Sunbeam, Karrier and Guy trolleybus operation was the largest in Britain and possibly the world. In 1954 Sunbeam Commercial Vehicles moved within Wolverhampton from the Moorfield Works in Blakenhall to new extensions at Guy Motors Fallings Park. Guy Motors was bought by Jaguar Cars in 1961 and was closed by Jaguar's parent company, British Leyland, in 1982.","[""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/BCLM_Wallsall_trolleybus.jpg?width=300""]","[""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/BCLM_Wallsall_trolleybus.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Sunbeam_Works_Upper_Villiers_St_Wolverhampton.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Bradford&apos;s_last_Trolleybus_at_Thornbury_Depot_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1390845.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Cape_Town_trolleybus_number_86_-_1940.png"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Perth_trolleybus_number_41_-_1950.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Tetley_Bitter_Advert_on_Bradford_Trolleybus_Cropped.jpg""]"

The railway is owned by Canadian Pacific Railway Limited, which began operations as legal owner in a corporate restructuring in 2001. Headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, it owns approximately 20,100 kilometres (12,500 mi) of track in seven provinces of Canada and into the United States, stretching from Montreal to Vancouver, and as far north as Edmonton. Its rail network also serves Minneapolis–St. Paul, Milwaukee, Detroit, Chicago, and Albany, New York in the United States. The railway was first built between eastern Canada and British Columbia between 1881 and 1885 (connecting with Ottawa Valley and Georgian Bay area lines built earlier), fulfilling a commitment extended to British Columbia when it entered Confederation in 1871; it was Canada's first transcontinental railway. Primarily a freight railway, the CPR was for decades the only practical means of long-distance passenger transport in most regions of Canada, and was instrumental in the settlement and development of Western Canada. The CPR became one of the largest and most powerful companies in Canada, a position it held as late as 1975. Its primary passenger services were eliminated in 1986, after being assumed by Via Rail Canada in 1978. The company acquired two American lines in 2009: the Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern Railroad (DM&E) and the Iowa, Chicago and Eastern Railroad (IC&E). The trackage of the IC&E was at one time part of CP subsidiary Soo Line and predecessor line The Milwaukee Road. The combined DM&E/IC&E system spanned North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Nebraska and Iowa, with two short stretches into Kansas City, Missouri, and a line to Chicago, Illinois. The railroad also has regulatory approval to build a line into the Powder River Basin of Wyoming. It is publicly traded on both the Toronto Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker CP. Its U.S. headquarters are in Minneapolis.","[""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Canadian_Pacific_Railway_logo_2014.svg?width=300"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Canadian_Pacific_Railway_logo_2014.svg""]","[""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Land_Ticket.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Canadian_Pacific_2816.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Canadian_Pacific_-_Trans_Canada_passenger_train.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Canadian_Pacific_System_Railmap.png"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Canadian_Pacific_Railway_train_step_stool.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Canadian_Pacific_Ry_free_farms_1893.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Canadian_Pacific_Railway_Survey_Engineers,_1872.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Canadian_Pacific_Railway_logo_2014.svg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Canadian_Pacific_Railway_Crew_at_lower_Fraser_Valley_(1881).jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Canadian_Pacific_Railroad_2.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Canadian_Pacific_Railroad_2317.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Canadian_Pacific_Railroad_3.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Canadian_Pacific_Logo_1996.png"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Canadian_Pacific_Railroad_1.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Canadian_Pacific_First_Train.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Canadian_Trans-Continental_Railways.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/CPR_2816_Locomotive.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Campbellville_ON_GE-ES44AC_CP-8863_2011-08-23.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/CP_RAIL_TBAY.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/CP_Multimark.svg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Lethbridge_High_Level.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/CPtrainleavesBoltonpassingsiding.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Johnamacdonaldfuneraltrain.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/CP_7028.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/CP_8137_at_Chesterton_(31292201928).jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/CP_Holiday_Train.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Kamloops_on_to_Ottawa.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/EMD_SD60_SOO_6022.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Telegram_to_Prime_Minister_John_A._Macdonald_announcing_the_completion_of_the_Canadian_Pacific_Railway.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Map_of_part_of_Manitoba_and_the_Canadian_North-West_Territories_-_Alberta,_Assiniboia_and_Saskatchewan_shewing_system_of_land_survey_and_the_lines_of_the_Canadian_Pacific_Railway_CTASC.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Countess-1.gif"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/To_the_Far_East_by_the_white_Empress_route_(11411211505).jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Angus.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/William_Cornelius_Van_Horne.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/JaMAC.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/LastSpike_Craigellachie_BC_Canada.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/WCE_train_no._901_at_Waterfront.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Eastbound_over_SCB.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Royaltrain-hopebc.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Train_Noel_Canadien_Pacifique_Montreal_2009.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Crtc1.svg"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Eastbound_over_SCB.jpg""]"

The first Odeon cinema was opened by Oscar Deutsch in 1928, in Brierley Hill, Staffordshire (now West Midlands), although initially called ""Picture House"". The first cinema to use the Odeon brand name was Deutsch's cinema at Perry Barr, Birmingham in 1930. Ten years later Odeon was part of the Rank Organisation who continued their ownership of the circuit for a further sixty years. Through a number of sales and acquisitions in the early 2000s the company was purchased by Terra Firma, which merged Odeon and UCI Cinemas to form Odeon UCI Cinemas Group. Most UCI cinemas then took the Odeon brand name in 2006. Terra Firma/UCI sold the company to AMC Theatres in November 2016. Ironically, UCI was originally formed through the merger of AMC UK and Cinema International Corporation in 1989.

The structure, at 301 Park Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets, is a 47-story 625 ft (191 m) Art Deco landmark designed by architects Schultze and Weaver, which was completed in 1931. The building was the world's tallest hotel from 1931 until 1963, when it was surpassed by Moscow's Hotel Ukraina by 23 feet (7.0 m). An icon of glamour and luxury, the current Waldorf Astoria is one of the world's most prestigious and best-known hotels. Waldorf Astoria Hotels & Resorts is a division of Hilton Hotels, and a portfolio of high-end properties around the world now operate under the name, including in New York City. Both the exterior and the interior of the Waldorf Astoria are designated by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission as official landmarks. The original Waldorf–Astoria was built in two stages, as the Waldorf Hotel and the Astoria Hotel, which accounts for its dual name. That original site was situated on Astor family properties along Fifth Avenue, opened in 1893, and designed by Henry J. Hardenbergh. It was demolished in 1929 to make way for the construction of the Empire State Building. Particularly after its relocation, the Waldorf Astoria gained international renown for its lavish dinner parties and galas, often at the center of political and business conferences and fundraising schemes involving the rich and famous. Particularly after World War II it played a significant role in world politics and the Cold War, culminating in the controversial World Peace Conference of March 1949 at the hotel, whose Stalinism was widely denounced. Conrad Hilton acquired management rights to the hotel on October 12, 1949, and the Hilton Hotels Corporation finally bought the hotel outright in 1972. It underwent a $150 million renovation by Lee Jablin in the 1980s and early 1990s, and in October 2014 it was announced that the Anbang Insurance Group of China had purchased the Waldorf Astoria New York for US$1.95 billion, making it the most expensive hotel ever sold. Anbang then converted the Waldorf's upper-floor hotel rooms into 375 condominiums, closing the hotel for a three-year renovation on March 1, 2017. The renovated structure will retain 375 hotel rooms on the lowest 18 floors. As of late 2020, the hotel was expected to reopen by 2022. The Waldorf Astoria and Towers has a total of 1,413 hotel rooms as of 2014. In 2009, when it had 1,416 rooms, the main hotel had 1,235 single and double rooms and 208 mini suites, while the Waldorf Towers, from the 28th floor up to the 42nd, had 181 rooms, of which 115 were suites, with one to four bedrooms. Several of the luxury suites are named after celebrities who lived or stayed in them such as the Cole Porter Suite, the Royal Suite, named after the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, the MacArthur Suite, and the Churchill Suite. The most expensive room, the Presidential Suite, is designed with Georgian-style furniture to emulate that of the White House. It was the residence of Herbert Hoover from his retirement for over 30 years, and Frank Sinatra kept a suite at the Waldorf from 1979 until 1988. The hotel has three main restaurants: Peacock Alley, The Bull and Bear Steak House, and La Chine—a new Chinese restaurant that replaced Oscar's Brasserie in late 2015. Sir Harry's Bar, also located in the hotel, is named after British explorer Sir Harry Johnston.","[""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/St_Bartholomews_and_The_Waldorf_Astoria_Hotel.jpg?width=300"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Waldorf_Astoria_NY_logo.svg""]","[""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Waldorf_Towers_suite_30A.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Oscar-Tschirky.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/58th_International_Debutante_Ball_2012,_New_York_City_(Waldorf-Astoria_Hotel).jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Elizabeth_Taylor-1945.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/President_Hoover_portrait.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/US_Senate_Committee_hearings_Titanic_sinking_1912.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Conrad_Hilton_(croped).jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Cast_from_Parks_and_Recreation,_Portlandia_and_Game_of_Thrones_at_the_71st_Annual_Peabody_Awards.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/St_Bartholomews_and_The_Waldorf_Astoria_Hotel.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Eleanor_Roosevelt_and_the_Royal_Family_of_Norway_with_Princess_Juliana_of_the_Netherlands_and_Thomas_Watson_-_NARA_-_195657.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Australian_$5_-_original_series_-_reverse.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/(Portrait_of_Frank_Sinatra,_Liederkrantz_Hall,_New_York,_N.Y.,_ca._1947)_(LOC)_(4843758334).jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Women_in_Waldorf-Astoria.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Elbert_Henry_Gary_banquet_at_Waldorf-Astoria_1909.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Khrushchev_family_at_the_Waldorf-Astoria_1959.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/William_Waldorf_Astor.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Dwight_D._Eisenhower,_official_photo_portrait,_May_29,_1959.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Waldorf_-_Astoria_ad_1933.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Waldorf_Astoria,_NY.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Waldorf_Astoria_NY_logo.svg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Waldorf_Astoria_buffet.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Waldorf_Astoria_exterior.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Waldorf_Astoria_foyer.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Waldorf_Astoria_lobby_view_2.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/NY_Octagon_Room_Waldof_Astoria_Hotel_1893.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Waldolfastoriaelevatorlobby.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Waldorf-Astoria_1904-1908b.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Waldorf-Astoria_menu_Archbishop_of_York_dinner.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/The_Waldorf_and_The_Astoria_Hotels,_New_York_City_c1915.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Elsa_Maxwell_Marilyn_Monroe_April_in_Paris_Ball_1957.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Waldorfsalat.jpg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Marlene_Dietrich_April_in_Paris_Ball_1959.jpg"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Waldorf-Astoria_1904-1908.jpg"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Flags_on_the_Waldorf,_1916_Childe_Hassam.jpg"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:0360New_York_City_Waldorf_A.jpg"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Waldorf_old.jpg"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Waldorf_Astoria_foyer.jpg"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Demolished_Astoria_hotel,_NYC.jpg"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Waldorf-equal.jpg"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Waldorf-Astoria_Park_Avenue_Entrance.jpg"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Waldorf_Astoria_Hotel.jpg"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Waldorf_Astoria,_NY.jpg"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Waldorf_Astoria_lobby_view_2.jpg"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Waldorf-Astoria,_New_York_City,_2006.jpeg"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Waldorf_Astoria_1899.jpg"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Waldorf-Astoria_1904-1908b.jpg"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Waldorf-park.jpg"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:St_Bartholomews_and_The_Waldorf_Astoria_Hotel.jpg"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Waldorf_Hotel_1893.jpg"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Waldolfastoriaelevatorlobby.JPG""]"

The goal was to create rooms of 228 square feet with ""clever"" bathrooms. The brand uses platform beds instead of box springs and uses a landing zone where guests can place their luggage and hang their clothes rather than a dresser. Hilton realized that they could shrink the width of the room from the typical 12 feet to 10 feet because typically the TV cabinet would take up 2 feet, but with flat screen TV's the space could be spared. The desk that was decided to be used is a portable chair attached to a table allowing the guest to use the chair wherever they want in the room.

Hulu was initially established as a joint venture between News Corporation and NBC Universal, Providence Equity Partners, and later The Walt Disney Company, serving as an aggregation of recent episodes of television series from their respective television networks. In 2010, Hulu became the first streaming service to add ""Plus"" to its name when it launched a subscription service, initially branded as Hulu Plus, which featured full seasons of programs from the companies and other partners, and undelayed access to new episodes. In 2017, the company launched Hulu with Live TV—an over-the-top IPTV service featuring linear television channels. As of the third quarter of 2021, Hulu has 42.8 million subscribers. Disney controls Hulu while Comcast has a stake in Hulu but doesn't play a major role in its upkeep.","[""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Hulu_logo_flat.svg?width=300"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hulu_logo_(2014).svg""]","[""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Hulu_Logo.svg"",""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Huluownership.jpg""]"
